<p class="ph3">THE EVIDENCE FOR EVOLUTION</p>


<p>The idea of Evolution is an old one. It is older than the
Darwinian hypothesis; it is older than Lamarck, who published
his particular theory in 1809, the year that Darwin was born;
it is older than Buffon or Kant. In a fairly definite form it is
as old as Aristotle. The Evolution idea has thus itself evolved,
and is the product of many centuries of thought. Yet it was only
the last generation that began to give the idea serious consideration,
and it is perhaps only the present that has granted it any
general measure of acceptance; and it was Darwin who wrought
this change, who raised the conception of Evolution from the
status of a vague speculative idea to that of a well-grounded
theory, which appeals to the majority of educated minds as
satisfactory and reasonable.</p>

<p>We do not here propose to sketch the development of the
idea, either before or after Darwin; but only, in the first place,
to state the grounds on which the belief in Evolution is based,
and, in the second, to trace roughly the lines along which animal
Evolution has proceeded. In the first few pages of this book,
then, we shall endeavour to bring forward some of the evidence on
which the modern Evolution theory rests.</p>

<p class="mt4">From the time when the world was sufficiently cooled for
water to condense on its surface, a continual process of unbuilding
and rebuilding of rocks has gone on. Wind and water, heat and
cold have laid their hands to the work, making sand and dust
and gravel out of solid stone, and these products of their labours
have been carried off to other places, laid down, and cemented
together into new rocks. We do not know the exact age of any
particular rock that has been made in this way, nor how long the
process has been going on. At a rough guess it may be three or
four hundreds of millions of years. The chronological succession
of the different rock formations is, however, known, and their
relative ages may be judged with considerable accuracy. Here
and there, as time went on, the body of a plant or an animal
was deposited in the sand or mud or chalk, and has remained
in the resulting rocks, in the form of a fossil, through all the
ages. If, then, we study the occurrence of fossils in this succession
of deposits, we ought to get some indications as to
the inhabitants of the globe at various stages of its history.
And if we do so, we meet unmistakable evidence that the
lower and simpler types, both of animals and of plants,
were in existence before the higher. Fig. 2 shows the facts
with regard to the vertebrates, the great upper class of the
animal kingdom. The first appearance of vertebrate fossils is
in the Upper Silurian rocks, that is to say, somewhere after
the middle of geological time. The fossils represent the
lowest group of fishes. In the next great formation, the
Devonian, fossils of two higher groups of fishes are to be found.
The first land vertebrates, the amphibians, are doubtfully represented
in the upper or newer layers of the same formation, and
definitely so in the next, the Carboniferous. Towards the end of
the Carboniferous or early in the Permian epoch, the first reptiles
appear, and in the following period, or after about three-fourths
of geological time had passed, the earliest fossils of mammals
occur. The significance of this sequence will become plainer when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a><br /><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a><br /><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>the differences and likenesses of these various groups are explained.
Each of these great groups in turn formed the dominant animal
population of the globe, and each in turn was superseded, although
not entirely, by the next. The mammal group itself appears
to be on the wane, overcome in the struggle for dominance by
its own latest and most remarkable member, man himself.</p>

<p class="mt4">The broad facts in the history of living things upon the earth
are, then, in accordance with the theory of Evolution. The chain
of types is indeed a broken one, the gaps being many, and some
of them wide. But this is readily to be understood from the comparative
scarcity of fossils, and the imperfection of the geological
record.</p>

<p>In certain particular instances, however, very complete series of
fossil forms have been discovered, connecting, by small gradations,
modern animals with greatly different extinct types. One
of the most complete of such series has been discovered for
the horse. The changes that have occurred in the evolution of
this animal have been mainly in three directions&mdash;increase in
size, reduction in the number of toes from the original five to
the final one, and deepening of the crowns of the teeth, so as to
render them capable of longer wear. From the Eohippus of
early tertiary times, an animal of about the size of a fox terrier,
with five toes behind, and four with the vestige of the fifth in
front, there is a complete connecting series reaching up to the
modern horse, with its single remaining toe and the vestiges of two
others. A few of the main links in this chain are illustrated in
Fig. 3. It is impossible to regard such a series without having
the idea of Evolution strongly suggested to the mind.</p>

<p>In the second place, there is evidence for Evolution in the
fact that marked changes can and do occur in the characters of
living races of organisms. There is ample evidence, for example,
that all our modern breeds of pigeons are descended from the wild
rock-dove. How markedly some of these differ from their wild
ancestor, and among themselves, may be seen from Fig. 4.
The size of some is twice as great as that of others. The bill in
some is greatly increased in length, is almost ludicrously reduced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a><br /><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a><br /><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>in others. Colour, feathering, build, even the instincts and the
voice, vary enormously as between different varieties. In short,
there is hardly any obvious character that has not, in one or other
of the breeds, undergone great modification. As Darwin remarked,
any naturalist coming upon such a group of forms in nature
would have no hesitation in placing them in different species or
genera, or even perhaps in different families. Even granting
that the conditions of domestication are peculiar, we must admit
that if such large changes can occur in a few centuries, it is possible
that man has evolved from the lowest of living organisms during a
period some hundreds of thousands of times as long.</p>

<p>But marked changes of type occur not only under conditions
of domestication; nor is it necessary to infer the occurrence
of any such changes without actual direct evidence. The formation
of new types occurs in nature, and has taken place under the
very eyes of scientific observers. Perhaps the most striking case
that can be quoted is that of Lamarck's Evening Primrose, which,
under the observation of Prof. De Vries in Amsterdam, produced
some half-dozen of 'sports' which seem well entitled to rank as
new species. Fig. 5 shows the parent plant and two of the
new types that were produced by it. One is a dwarf in habit,
the other is characterised by the greatly increased breadth of its
foliage. Others showed different peculiarities. One might quote
many other instances of violent changes of type&mdash;of the appearance
of six-fingered children, whose peculiarity was afterwards
inherited; of web-footed pigeons, and of new varieties of fruits,
flowers, and vegetables. The causes of such 'sports' or mutations
are unknown, but their moderately frequent occurrence is abundantly
demonstrated. Such facts show, at all events, that the
old conception of species as permanently fixed, unchanging types,
can no longer reasonably be held.</p>

</div>

<p>Not all of the abnormalities which thus suddenly appear, we
know not how or wherefore, are new. Many recall characters in
lower or older groups, and may reasonably be interpreted as
'reversions.' Thus the horse's leg shown in Fig. 6 bears a well-developed
side toe, in place of the small vestige that is normally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
present. Horses with this peculiarity have occurred with some
frequency, probably before, and certainly since, the most famous
of their kind, which Julius Cæsar rode. It seems reasonable
to regard this peculiarity as a return to the old ancestral
condition illustrated before, in which the side toes were well
developed. The same applies to the instance of a persistent tail
and persistent gill slits in man (Figs. 7 and 8), and to many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
other instances that might be quoted. One must indeed deal
carefully with such cases, for it is always difficult to say what
changes are new departures, and what are returns to ancestral
types. There is danger of arguing in a circle&mdash;of supposing the
ancestry from the abnormality, and of terming the latter a reversion
because it suggests the supposed ancestry. Nevertheless,
when variations occur, suggesting characters which are believed,
on other grounds, to be ancestral, they must tend to strengthen
the other evidence as to the evolution of the type in question.</p>

</div>

<p>Another and a very strong evidence of Evolution is to be
found in what are termed vestigeal structures, two of which are
illustrated in Figs. 9 and 10. They are, for the most part, obviously
useless, and their occurrence has never been satisfactorily explained
except by supposing them to be remnants of organs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
that were functional in the past history of their possessors' race.
The appendix of man, for instance, is not only useless, but is
frequently a source of danger. But its presence is readily explained
by supposing that it represents the blind-gut, which is
large and functional in many of the lower animals. Again, how
should we account for the presence of small functionless wing-bones
in the cassowary, unless by supposing that its ancestors
were accustomed to fly like ordinary birds? How should we
explain the bones which represent the hind limbs of the whale,
unless by regarding the whale as descended from an animal
which had functional hind limbs, or the representatives of eyes
in animals that live in the dark, unless by supposing that these
are descended from ancestors which saw? It has been well said
that the bodies of many animals are veritable antiquarian museums,
filled with relics of their own ancestors.</p>

<p>The next argument for Evolution to which we would refer is
based on the similar structure and origin of organs or members
that have entirely different uses. In Fig. 11 are figured the bones
of the fore limbs of four different mammals, a whale, a bat, a
dog, and man. The first is used for swimming, the second for
flight, the third for locomotion on land, and the fourth as a grasping
and holding organ. If these organs had been specially designed,
each for its specific purpose, we should expect to find
fundamental differences in structure. Actually the general
arrangement of bones is the same in each case. A fact
like this points strongly to a common origin of the four types
mentioned, and to a general primitive arrangement of the bones
of the limb. This primary type, it seems natural to suppose, has
been modified for various special purposes in many different
directions, the general features remaining recognisable. Many
other cases of homology, or similarity of structure and origin,
in organs whose function is dissimilar, might be quoted. Thus
the poison gland of the poison snakes is not an organ which has
been specially developed, but is a modified portion of one of the
salivary glands. The hoof of the horse and the finger nail of man
can evidently be satisfactorily explained as modifications of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a><br /><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a><br /><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
general type of terminal claw, and the scales of the scaly ant-eater
and the quills of the porcupine are only modified hairs.
The significance of facts like these, when carefully considered, is
very great.</p>

</div>

<p>The study of the geographical distribution of animals has
brought forth a great mass of facts which, considered by themselves,
seem chaotic and meaningless, but which, in the light
of Evolution, are full of significance. Observe, for example, the
distribution of the Marsupials or pouch-bearing animals, shown
on the accompanying map (Fig. 12). Australia is full of them,
while they are relatively meagrely represented in a few other parts
of the world. At the same time the greater and higher group of
mammals was represented in Australia, at the time of its discovery,
only by the bushman and his dog and a few species of
mice. It is not as if the Australian environment were specially
well adapted for marsupials, or specially ill-adapted for higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
mammals; for the sheep has proved itself splendidly adapted for
the conditions, and the rabbit most inconveniently so. Why, then,
this curious state of affairs? It is an undoubted fact that the marsupials
are both lower in their position in the animal kingdom, and
older, than the main group to which all our European mammals
belong. Now it is believed that Australia was once connected
by land with the Asiatic Continent, and that it was finally separated
from it before the higher mammals were in existence. The
great step of further progress occurred elsewhere than in Australia,
and the mammals of the latter continent were left in their obsolete
condition, preserved through lack of competition of that higher
type which elsewhere became dominant.</p>

<p>Madagascar offers a similar case. It abounds with forest
vegetation and seems to offer a highly suitable environment for
the monkey tribe. Yet there are no apes on the island. Their
place is occupied by the Lemur tribe, which, there is every reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
to believe, is the older group of the two, and that from which
the apes have sprung. It is supposed, then, that Madagascar
was separated from Africa before the ape had evolved. The
lemurs thenceforward were free from the competition of their
more highly developed relatives, and have branched out into a
great variety of types, while still remaining on a relatively low
plane of intelligence and specialisation. The distribution of the
Lemurs is shown in Fig. 13.</p>

<p>In Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace's book on <cite>Island Life</cite> there
are set forth a great number of interesting facts on the subject
of the animal population of islands, and many striking interpretations
of these facts in the light of the Evolution theory.
Coral islands, and those caused by volcanic eruptions, are peopled
with inhabitants which have accidentally come thither by flight,
or have been brought, for example, on floating timber by ocean
currents. On the other hand, islands which represent separated
fragments of continents have usually a fauna of the same general
type as that of the continent of which they have formed a part.
But the actual species are frequently different, and if the separation
is of more ancient date, the differences are still more marked.
The fact of this divergence of an isolated animal population from
that from which it has originated is sufficiently striking, and
would remain an inexplicable problem, were we without an
Evolution theory. According to the Evolution hypothesis, however,
the restricted and somewhat special environment favours
a modification of the original types with which the island was
provided, and a satisfactory explanation is offered.</p>

<p>Finally, we may mention the evidence that has been gathered
from the study of embryology and development. It has been
stated, in a metaphor which is perhaps more clever than it is
exact, that every animal climbs up its own ancestral tree; and
while it would be absurd to say, for instance, that a mammalian
embryo resembles successively a fish, an amphibian, and a reptile,
still many of the broad facts in the evolution of a race seem to
be repeated, in a more or less blurred and indistinct fashion, in
the development of the individual. Thus, for example, gill-slits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a><br /><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a><br /><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>and a tail are possessed in common by the embryos of all higher
animals, only afterwards to disappear in those types in which
the adult animal is without these structures. The heart of the
mammal or bird is at first simple, then two chambered like that
of a fish, then three chambered like an amphibian's, and finally
four chambered. Some of the main phases in the development
of the rabbit and of man are shown in Figs. 14 and 15 respectively.</p>

</div>

<p>The young flat-fish is like an ordinary member of the fish
tribe, with an eye on either side of its head, and its body built on
the ordinary symmetrical lines. It is only later, when it begins
habitually to be upon one side on the sea bottom, that the eye
from the under side wanders round to the opposite aspect beside
its fellow, and the upper side becomes pigmented, while the
lower remains white.</p>

<p>In similar fashion a primitive form of kidney is, as it were,
sketched in, in the development of the higher animals, only to
be erased at a later stage and replaced by a better form. The
human child has a complete body covering of hair, which disappears
soon after birth. In these and many more instances,
one cannot avoid the impression that the organism has not been
specially designed for what it finally comes to be. It cannot
forget, and must needs repeat, or so it seems, some considerable
part of the history of its race.</p>

<p>Manifestly, then, all this evidence, gleaned from many
different sources, points to a common origin of living things,
and to the gradual evolution of the higher from the lower types.
It may also be said that there is no scientific evidence against
such a view.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">UNICELLULAR AND MULTICELLULAR ANIMALS</p>


<p>We must now turn to the main project of this book, which is
to attempt to trace out the lines along which animal Evolution
has proceeded, with special reference to that particular line
which leads up to man. Indeed, we shall have to stick somewhat
closely to this one main highway, and can but barely pause to
glance along the numerous branch roads, interesting though the
travelling there might be.</p>

<p>It is perhaps necessary to say, at the outset, that the history
of the Evolution of man cannot be written as a plain, matter-of-fact
tale. Many portions of this history are tolerably well understood,
but there are other periods, in some of which notable steps
of progress were made, of which no record has ever been discovered.
We must therefore expect occasionally to be reduced to speculation,
and here and there to meet with controversy and with
opposing theories.</p>

<p>It is not proposed here to enter into any full discussion as to
the origin of life. It may shortly be said that in the existing
state of knowledge, no very definite theory is possible. We
know that life is associated with a jelly-like or semi-fluid substance
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">protoplasm</i>, which consists of a very complex mixture of
albuminoids. These albuminoids are continually undergoing
changes and interactions of a complex kind, the sum total of which
constitutes life. Many of these reactions have been reproduced,
or imitated, artificially, and have been shown to be purely chemical
or physical. The chemical nature of the albuminoids is indeed
so complex that some considerable time must yet elapse before
it can be completely investigated; and until such time it is obvious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
that we cannot hope for any very definite conceptions as to the
nature of life. Broadly, however, the majority of physiologists
regard life as a highly intricate series of purely physical and
chemical processes, and if such a view be accepted, there is no
insuperable objection to a general theory of the origin of living
from non-living matter. By this it is not intended to imply that
the manufacture of living matter is an immediate possibility;
for even according to such a theory as we have indicated, it would
be supposed that living substance came into being by a very slow
process of Evolution, which it is hardly conceivable could ever
be repeated in the laboratory. Knowing, as we do, that there
was a time when no life existed upon the earth, and believing, as
there is good reason to believe, that there is no fundamental
distinction between living processes and ordinary chemical and
physical reactions, we may logically regard life itself as a product
of a natural process of Evolution.</p>

<p>To begin at the beginning of our tale, we may ask ourselves
what are the lowest, simplest, living things that are known.
The question does not admit of any very definite answer. For
as we look around among a number of the most simple forms,
we find ourselves handicapped in our attempt to judge between
them, by a lack of knowledge of their nature. We come upon
organisms so small that they appear, even under the most powerful
microscope, only as the tiniest specks; whose size is to be measured
in hundredths of thousandths of an inch. We even find good
evidence that living things exist which we are unable, in any
manner whatsoever, to see. Among the smallest known forms,
and also among some of the larger, we find organisms that we can
only describe as practically structureless, that appear as specks
of almost homogeneous protoplasm; but it seems reasonable to
suppose that this appearance is due rather to our imperfect
observation than to an actual absence of differentiation.</p>

<p>It is certain, however, that the lowest of the great groups is
that of the one-celled organisms. As all the higher types are
built up of large numbers of cells, essentially similar to those
which constitute the unicellular forms, it is important that we
should know something of the nature of this organic unit. A
typical cell is illustrated in Fig. 16. It consists of a mass of
protoplasm, with a distinctly differentiated portion called the
nucleus. The function of the nucleus is that of directing and
controlling the activities of the cell; if it is removed, the remaining
portion of the cell soon dies; while, on the other hand, a small
portion of the cell, if it contains the nucleus, may frequently
live, and build up new protoplasm to replace what was lost. Cells
are formed only from previously existing cells, by a process of
division, which is usually simply one of halving. This process
is begun in the nucleus; it undergoes a complex rearrangement
of its parts, the object of which appears to be to insure an absolute
equality in the halves, and finally divides in two. The bulk of
the protoplasm then separates into two portions, a portion remaining
round each of the nuclei. The process of cell division is
illustrated in Fig. 17.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Now it is a somewhat remarkable fact that we do not know
whether or not all the humbler forms of life possess a nucleus.
It was formerly believed that a considerable number of one-celled
organisms were devoid of the body in question, but in most of
such it has been shown that nuclear matter is present, though it
may be distributed, in small portions, throughout the cell. If
organisms do exist which consist of a cell without a nucleus, we
must regard them as the simplest of living things. In any case,
the formation of a nucleus, a process by which a kind of central
government was formed, was
probably one of the great early
steps of Evolution.</p>

</div>

<p>The life-history of an ordinary
one-celled organism may
be briefly summed up. It
absorbs nourishment and
energy, adds to its substance
until it reaches a certain fairly
definite size, and then divides in
two, the halves separating, and
going each its own way. In the
world of one-celled organisms
there is no 'death from natural
causes.' The individual is
potentially immortal, except in
so far as we may regard the individual life as ceasing when division
takes place. Death occurs only, as we say, accidentally&mdash;for
example, from starvation or from the attacks of enemies.
A number of simple unicellular organisms are shown in
Figs. 18, 19, and 20.</p>

<p>The reader will have observed that we have referred to the
group under consideration in general terms, and without endeavouring
to classify its members as plants or animals. And
indeed it is impossible to carry this great distinction down to the
lowest group of the organic world. This stands below the first
great forking of the tree of life; its members remain in what has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
been described as a condition of 'chronic indecision,' neither
clearly vegetable nor definitely animal. But very soon, in the
march of progress, the forking of the
roads was reached, and whosoever
was bent on journeying farther had
perforce to make the choice. We
must here briefly consider what this
choice was, and wherein the fundamental
distinction between a plant
and an animal consists; for, strange
as the statement may seem, the basis
of this distinction is by no means
generally appreciated.</p>

<p>The typical plant lives by absorbing
carbon dioxide gas, water, and
mineral salts from the surrounding media. These substances,
by means of energy which it gathers from the rays of the sun,
the plant builds up into organic substances, to be used in the
maintenance of life,
and for growth and
reproduction. This
process of chemical
construction occurs
only in the green,
exposed parts of the
plant, and indeed can
occur only in the presence
of chlorophyll,

matter of the leaves.</p>

<p>The animal, on the
other hand, lives by
appropriating, either
directly or indirectly, what the plant has produced. All flesh is
indeed grass, in a different sense from that originally intended by
the statement. It is this essential difference which lies at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
root of all the plain and obvious distinctions between animals
and plants. The plant has neither the necessity to go forth in
search of its food materials, which nature brings to it, nor has it
to spare of its painfully collected energy for the labour of locomotion.
Hence it remains stationary. The animal must of necessity
go to seek its more elaborate fare, therefore it moves. Moreover,
to be successful in its search, the animal obviously requires
a nervous system to direct and control its movements, which
system, except in the simplest and crudest forms, is absent from
the plant. In the main, then, the plant builds up and saves, the
animal breaks down and spends. The plant is the producer,
the animal the consumer.</p>

</div>

<p>Turning now to those of the lower organisms that are somewhat
more definitely animal in nature, we may describe the common
Am&oelig;ba. Microscopic in size, this creature consists of a speck of
semi-liquid protoplasm, which is irregular and ever-changing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
shape. It is continually
pushing out finger-like projections
from various parts
of its surface, feeling, in a
dim, vague way, for its food.
It moves, if but slowly, by
withdrawing its substance in
one direction and pouring it
forth in another. It indulges
in such fare as bacteria or
particles of dead organic
matter and feeds by the
simple method of surrounding
the food particle with
its protoplasm, and gradually
digesting and absorbing
whatever it contains of nutriment.
Undigested portions
are simply left behind as the
creature moves on. The
waste products are drained
into a simple cavity in the
protoplasm called the contractile
vacuole, which empties
itself periodically to the
outside. The Am&oelig;ba reproduces
by the ordinary
process of simple fission,
illustrated, with the creature
in its ordinary condition, in
Figs. 21 and 22.</p>

<p>Somewhat higher than
the Am&oelig;ba, and apparently
along the main line of progress,
stands the group
which includes the slipper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
animalcule, Param&oelig;cium, shown in Fig. 23. This creature, barely
visible to the naked eye, is found in pools of water, or, for
example, in drops of rain or dew on plants, and it can generally
be obtained in great numbers by soaking a little hay in water for
a day or two. It has, as may be seen from the illustration, an
elongated shape, with a depression, the mouth, about the middle
of one side. The progress made good from the stage of the Am&oelig;ba
has been largely in the direction of a more efficient method of
locomotion. Instead of crawling, with painful slowness, the
Param&oelig;cium swims freely and rapidly by means of the numerous
whip-like projections or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cilia</i> which cover it, and with which it
lashes the water. An advance is also to be recognised in the
fact that the organism is surrounded by a dense outer wall; and
that its shape is consequently fixed. Hence also the Param&oelig;cium
cannot take in food at any part of its surface, as the Am&oelig;ba can,
but only through the special depression already mentioned.
Excretion is carried on in the same manner as in the Am&oelig;ba.
The Param&oelig;cium is a water animal, yet it can resist drying, and
remain alive in the absence of water, for a long period. This it
accomplishes by becoming encysted, that is, by contracting into a
ball and surrounding itself with a resistant shell, from which it
can emerge when suitable conditions for active life return. It
is worth passing notice that there exist a number of forms occupying
a position intermediate between the two types which we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
described, and indicating that the second has, in all probability,
been derived from the first. One of these is shown on Fig. 24.</p>

    the free-swimming Param&oelig;cium
    type.</p></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>There is another interesting fact in connection with Param&oelig;cium.
Under natural conditions,
division and redivision continue in the
ordinary way for a large and indefinite
number of generations. But very occasionally,
a process known as <em>conjugation</em>
occurs. Two individuals lay themselves
side by side, and partially unite; they
exchange portions of their nuclear substance,
and finally separate again, simple
division afterwards proceeding as before.
Conjugation, although distinctly different
from the ordinary process of sexual reproduction,
appears to serve the same
purpose. Until quite lately its meaning,
and that of the process of sexual reproduction
in general, seemed to bid fair to
remain a perpetual puzzle to biologists.
But at last we seem to be approaching the
solution. The characters of a species are
determined, it is tolerably certain, by
the constitution of the cell nucleus, and
accordingly as this varies from one individual
to another, so the characters of
the individuals will vary. Now, if simple
division were to continue indefinitely,
successive generations would be produced
on the same plan, and the racial
characters would in the main remain
constant. But conditions of life vary
from time to time and from place to place, and the particular
type which succeeds best under one set of circumstances
may be ill adapted for another. It is therefore an
advantage to a race to be capable of variation. And the process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of sexual reproduction, by continually bringing about a mixture
of the nuclear substance, ensures the regular production of a
variety of types. Of these various combinations of characters
the few that are suited to the prevailing conditions will, for the
time being, constitute the dominant types. When conditions
change, fresh types will be available to replace them. The process
of conjugation is illustrated in Fig. 25.</p>

<p>There are many groups of one-celled animals other than those
typified in the Am&oelig;ba and the Param&oelig;cium, but they do not
appear to have any significance so far as the descent of the higher
animals is concerned, and they therefore do not immediately
concern us.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned that water is the life medium of
the slipper animalcule. It was destined to remain the natural
element, both of animals and of plants, throughout many subsequent
stages of progress. The reason of this is not far to seek.
Active protoplasm consists to the extent of about three-fourths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of water, and a plentiful supply of this is one of the essentials for
the continuance of active life. Therefore, before the conquest
of the dry land could be accomplished, devices had to be evolved
both for maintaining and for conserving the water supply&mdash;roots
in the plant; in the animal, some method of locomotion by land
or air, so that water could be frequently reached; protection
against evaporation, in the form of a skin, in both; and numerous
other special devices. Add to this the fact that locomotion on
land presents much greater difficulties than that in water, and it will
hardly occasion surprise that vast ages were yet to be required
before the Evolution process could produce a land animal.</p>

<p>A striking analogy may be drawn between animal Evolution,
from this point onwards, and social Evolution. In the latter
case we begin with men, brought by a slow process of Evolution
to a high state of individual perfection, living in a state of savage
individualism. Each thinks and acts for himself, provides his own
food, raiment, and dwelling; constitutes his own standing army
and police. From this condition of affairs there has gradually
been developed the modern social arrangement, by which each
individual helps to carry out some distinctly special part of work
for the community&mdash;be it wheat-growing, cloth-weaving, bricklaying,
or the arresting of burglars&mdash;and trusts to the community
for his requirements in all other directions. These requirements
themselves have so multiplied during the course of social Evolution
that innumerable forms of activity have sprung up between those
occupations which provide the original necessities of life. The
essence of the whole process has been co-operation and the division
of labour.</p>

<p>In the story of animal Evolution we have reached a point where
a highly perfected individual cell has been produced, which carries
out for itself, and for itself alone, all the activities of life. From
now onwards, co-operation and specialisation are the watchwords
of progress. There is a clubbing together, first of a few
cells, then of hundreds, and finally of millions upon millions, to
form the bodies corporate which we recognise as individual higher
animals. Division and distribution, subdivision and further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
distribution of the life activities proceed at the same time, until
we reach the condition prevailing in the higher animals, where the
degree of specialisation almost passes conception. In such there
is, to begin with, a vast frontier army of skin
cells, occupied in securing peace, as far as
possible, for the industries that go on within.
There are directors and controllers of these
industries&mdash;the brain cells&mdash;with a myriad of
workers under their guidance, and a great and
complex telegraph system between. The
workers themselves are of all descriptions&mdash;common
labourers like the cells of the muscles;
transport workers like those of the circulatory
system; skilled factory hands like those of
the glands; even scavengers in the shape of
the sweat gland and kidney cells. Nay,
there is even a numerous police force, of white blood corpuscles,
which patrol everywhere, arresting intruders and disposing of
them by the summary method of swallowing them whole.</p>

</div>

<p>Our information regarding the early
history of this co-operative movement
is fragmentary and incomplete, for
only an odd species or so seems to
survive of the group which we regard
as the earliest of multicellular animals.
In certain forms which are still essentially
unicellular, such as the Spondylomorum
shown in Fig. 26, there is a
tendency to form smaller or larger cell
colonies. When the individual cell
divides, the two daughter cells do
not separate, but remain somewhat
loosely attached to each other, and the
process of division without separation continues until a considerable
group is produced. From this colony occasional individuals
break away and proceed to form new colonies. From such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
a type it is a comparatively easy step to the Magosphæra described
by Haeckel and illustrated in Fig. 27. This consists of a simple
ball of ciliated cells, which reproduces by the occasional breaking
away of an individual member, which divides and redivides until
a new sphere is produced. Unfortunately this animal has only
once been discovered, and many hold that it has not been sufficiently
investigated. No other of the same type is known.</p>

<p>If we turn to the plant kingdom, however, we find a comparatively
common organism of somewhat similar form. This is
the Volvox, a plant which consists of some thousands of cells, and
reaches a size of about a pin-head. It has the form of a hollow
sphere, the wall of which is one cell thick, and the cavity of which
contains only water. The cells bear whip-like cilia on their outer
surface, by whose means the organism is able to move, swimming
by a rotary motion round a definite axis. The individual cells
are separated by layers of a gelatinous substance, through which,
however, pass connecting strands of protoplasm. The cells, of
course, contain the green colouring matter common to plants in
general. Distributed among the ordinary cells occur a few that
are distinguished by their larger size, and by the fact that they
lack cilia. These are the special reproductive members of the
colony. When the Volvox reaches maturity, these cells begin to
divide, and form new growths which take the form of hollow sacs,
which project into the cavity of the parent sphere. Later they
separate from the wall of the parent, and begin to move about, in
the internal cavity, by means of the cilia which they have developed.
Finally the parent breaks up and dies, and the progeny are set free
to commence life for themselves.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span>&mdash;Volvox. Male, showing packets of

</div>

<p>The fundamental importance of this type is that we have
already a division of the life activities. The majority of the
cells are concerned in the nutrition of the individual as a whole.
These ultimately perish. A minority, however, are fed and protected
by them, and these in return secure the perpetuation of
the race. This division into a mortal 'body' portion and an
immortal reproductive portion is the first and most important
division of the life activities, whether in the animal or in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
plant kingdoms. The body cells, modified in various directions
for their special purposes,
could not, and do
not, reproduce complete
new individuals. Therefore
a generalised type
of cell is maintained for
the express purpose of
the propagation of the
race. It is to be observed,
now, that the
process of reproduction
in Volvox is not always
such as we have described.
Sometimes the
reproductive cells are of
two kinds. The one type
divides into a great number
of small ciliated cells,
which escape separately
and directly to the <em>outside</em>
of the sphere, and
swim away. These free-swimming
individuals do
not form new colonies,
but seek out the reproductive
cells of the other
type, which latter still
form part of the organism
which has produced
them. One of the free-swimming
cells enters
each of those of the
other kind, and the
nuclei of the two merge into one. The cell so produced, after
a longer or shorter rest period, commences to divide and redivide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
in the manner already described, forming a new colony. The
process that we have described is that of sexual reproduction, and
its essential features are the same as in Volvox throughout the
whole animal kingdom. The small free-swimming cells are the
male reproductive bodies or sperms, the others are the female or
egg cells. The union of the two produces the fertilised egg, and
the process of union is termed fertilisation. In Volvox, the male
and female elements are sometimes produced by the same individual,
at other times by different ones. Separation of the
sexes is no necessary accompaniment of the process of sexual reproduction,
and indeed it is only in the higher groups of animals
that separate sexes are the rule. The various conditions in
Volvox are illustrated in Figs. 28, 29, and 30.</p>

showing egg cells (<em>O, O<sub>1</sub></em>), and sperms (<em>S<sub>1</sub> S<sub>2</sub> S<sub>3</sub></em>).</p></div>
</div>

<p>The next great groups of animals are, on the one hand, that
of the sponges, and, on the other, that which includes the sea-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>anemones,
jelly-fishes, corals, etc. At first sight their structure
seems vastly different to that of the Volvox, from some form
similar to which they have probably been derived. The evidence
obtained from the study of their individual development,
however, strongly suggests a process by which we suppose that
they evolved from Volvox-like ancestors. We shall therefore
briefly describe the earlier stages of the development of a coral.
The sexually produced individual starts life as a single cell, the
fertilised egg. This divides and redivides until a hollow ball
of cells is produced, which cells, like those of the Volvox, bear
cilia. Although simply spherical in shape, the creature moves by
rotating round a definite axis, like a planet. Moreover, nutriment
is absorbed not by any or every part of the surface, but
only by a small area round the lower pole. Now as development
proceeds, the cells at this pole divide more rapidly than the rest,
with the natural result that the ball begins to get out of shape.
The distended portion, however, develops to the inside, so that
one part of the sphere is, as it were, pushed into the other.
When this process has been completed, the original internal
cavity is almost entirely eliminated, and a form is produced which
resembles a double-walled flask or vase. Such a form may be
taken as the fundamental architectural type of the groups that
we are now to consider. The meaning of this further step of
Evolution is again specialisation. The inner layer of cells takes
on the functions of digestion and absorption of food, there having
been evolved, in fact, the simplest possible form of mouth and
stomach. Such other functions as those of locomotion, protection,
and support are exercised by the outer layer. This process is
illustrated in Fig. 31.</p>

      <em>E</em>, <em>F</em>, gastrula, or double-walled flask condition.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>But there is no known type of animal which, in its adult form,
shows quite the simple structure that we have described. Perhaps
the nearest approach is to be found in the lower sponges, in
which two modifications of the original plan have already been
introduced. In the first place, the creature is sedentary, being
fixed, in an inverted position, to some solid basis. It has, so to
speak, ceased to be a hunter, and is become a fisher. Secondly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a><br /><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
its wall is pierced in many places, so as to permit of a freer circulation,
through the digestive cavity, of the water which contains
the food material. The water passes in through these
numerous perforations, and out through the main central opening
or 'mouth.' The sponges do not appear to represent a stage
in the main line of Evolution, but lead us almost immediately into
a cul-de-sac. We therefore cannot pause to describe fully the
many peculiar and interesting developments which occurred in
the group. An ordinary 'sponge,' by the way, bears the same
relation to the creature which produces it as does a 'coral' to
the coral animal. It represents, that is to
say, the skeletons of a large colony of individuals.
The structure of a sponge is shown
in Fig. 32.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The other great group of primitive multicellular
animals is that of the C&oelig;lenterata,
and as an example of the most primitive of
these we may take the common freshwater
Hydra. The Hydra reaches a length of
nearly half an inch, and is to be found attached
to water-weed and the like in streams.
It consists of a hollow tube-shaped body
which is fixed by the so-called 'foot.' Two
layers of cells form the wall of this tube, these
being separated by a thin membrane of gelatinous material. At the
upper end is the mouth, which leads immediately into the internal
cavity or stomach. The mouth is surrounded by a ring of from six
to eight tentacles, which are outgrowths of both cell layers. The
cells of the inner layer are large, and bear cilia that protrude into
the internal cavity. Their functions are those of digestion and
absorption. Part of the protoplasm of the outer cells is modified
into a fibrous, contractile substance, which represents the beginnings
of muscle tissue. The outer layer also forms a protective
skin-like covering. In the outer layer also occur a large number
of stinging cells, each of which has a complex mechanism for
injecting a fluid poison into any creature which should happen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
to come in contact with them. These 'nettle cells' occur in
much greater numbers in the tentacles than elsewhere, and here
they are brought into play against the animals, such as minute
Crustaceans, which form the Hydra's prey. Coming in contact
with the tentacles, such creatures are caught, paralysed by means
of the stinging cells, and are gradually transferred into the mouth
by a slow contraction of the tentacles. The Hydra reproduces,
for the most part, by a simple process of budding. Small lateral
outgrowths are formed, which gradually develop mouth and
tentacles of their own. Ultimately these separate and are carried
off by the water, later to settle down and become attached to
some fixed object. Sometimes, however, sexual reproduction
occurs. The reproductive cells are produced, male and female
on the same individual, among the ordinary cells of the outer
layer. These are set free, fertilisation occurs in the water, and
the egg develops in the same manner as that of the coral. The
Hydra is able, by means of the fibrous protoplasm of its outer
cells, to show well-marked movements. It can bend its body in
this direction or that, can contract its whole body into a small
oval mass, and is even able, by performing a number of slow
somersaults, to change its position. The structure and the
methods of reproduction in Hydra will be readily understood
from the illustrations of the creature on Figs. 33 and 34.</p>

</div>

<p>If now we make a brief general survey of the group to which
the Hydra belongs, we find in it two somewhat strikingly different
types. On the one hand are sedentary forms that resemble, in a
general way, the Hydra; that consist of a tube-shaped body, with
the mouth, surrounded by a ring of tentacles, at the upper end.
The sea-anemones and corals are examples of this type, in which,
however, the structure shows various complexities as compared
with that of the Hydra, which complexities we cannot here pause
to describe. On the other hand is the well-known Medusa form,
of which the common jelly-fish is a typical example. This
creature, as is well known, is mushroom shaped, with tentacles
round the edge. The mouth is in the middle of the lower aspect,
at the end of a short 'stalk.' This type is very different in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a><br /><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a><br /><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a><br /><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a><br /><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>general appearance from the Hydra or sea-anemone, yet the one
form may be somewhat easily derived from the other; we have
only to imagine that a Hydra is turned upside down, that it is
squashed, vertically, until the internal cavity is greatly reduced,
and the circumference, especially in the region of the tentacles,
greatly increased, and we should have something resembling a
Medusa. That the two types are actually closely related is
shown by the fact that there is in the life-history of one group
of C&oelig;lenterates a regular alternation between the one and the
other.</p>

</div>

<p>If the above general conception of the structure of the Medusa
be borne in mind, its details will be easily understood. The
internal cavity, instead of being simple, has become complicated,
through the obliteration of certain parts of it, where the upper
and lower walls come in contact. What is left is a comparatively
small cavity immediately above the mouth, a number of symmetrically
arranged canals radiating out from this, and a ring
canal connecting the ends of these with each other. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
special characteristic is that there is a great mass of gelatinous
substance between the outer and inner cell layers. The reproductive
cells, as in the sea-anemones, are produced by the inner
cell layer, and escape by the mouth.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Something remains to be said regarding the specialisation of
tissues in this group. We have already mentioned the stinging
cells, and the beginnings of muscular tissue, in Hydra. The
former are a constant feature of the C&oelig;lenterates, while the latter
reaches a very considerable development in the higher forms, as
may be judged from the surprising rapidity with which the Medusa
can swim, or from the strength with which the sea-anemone
can retract its tentacles and draw itself together. Important,
further, is the nerve tissue. This consists of cells whose business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a><br /><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a><br /><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>it is to receive and transmit stimuli. They have long fibrous
projections connecting them with each other, so that there is a
network of communication throughout the whole animal. In
the Medusa, where co-ordinated movements of various portions
is necessary, there is a concentration of nerve cells into a double
ring near the edge.
Here also there are
special organs, probably
of sight and of
the sense of balance;
but as these cannot be
regarded as the forerunners
of the analogous
organs in higher
animals, we need not
pause to describe them.
The anatomy of the
C&oelig;lenterates will be
better understood if
the reader will study
the diagrams in Figs.
35 and 36, while some
idea of the beauty and
variety met with in the
group may be obtained
from Fig. 37.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>There is another
group of jellyfish-like
marine animals which
have been given the name of Ctenophora. By some they are
regarded as a divergent sub-class of the C&oelig;lenterates, by others
as a distinct main group; in any case they appear to be important
from our point of view. The structure of a typical member is
shown in Fig. 38, and a few other forms are illustrated in Fig. 39.
Our typical example is pear-shaped, with the mouth at the lower
pole. The internal cavity is complex, but is on a different plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
from that of the Medusa. There is a central cavity communicating
with the outside not only by the mouth but also by two canals
opening near the upper pole. There are two radial canals, each
of which divides into four, the branches of which lead at right
angles into other canals, running from pole to pole and blind
at both ends. There are two tentacles, as shown, which can be
withdrawn into special sacs. At the opposite end from the mouth
are sense organs, seemingly of smell and balance respectively.
On the outer surface, above each of the longitudinal canals, is a
row of small plates bearing cilia. It is by the movement of these
cilia, like a multitude of minute oars, that the animal swims&mdash;a
method of locomotion which does not occur in the true C&oelig;lenterates.
An additional feature is the formation, at an early stage
of development, of a definite third layer of cells between the
outer and the inner. This layer ultimately forms the greater
part of the jelly-like mass of the body.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_055.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 39.</span>&mdash;Group of Ctenophora.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Regarding the interrelationships of the various types that
we have described, and their respective importance with reference
to the descent of man, opinions are somewhat divided. Some
believe the Ctenophora to have been derived from the Medusa
form, but the more probable view seems to be that they have
evolved separately from some earlier and more primitive type
than any existing C&oelig;lenterate, and that their ancestors have all
been free-swimming and ciliated. Now the Ctenophora are considered,
on good grounds, to be somewhat nearly akin to the
lowest worms, and thus to stand fairly close to the main line of
Evolution. If this view be correct, the whole group of existing
C&oelig;lenterates forms a side branch of the Evolution tree. This
fact, however, does not take away the importance of the group
in relation to the theory of the descent of the higher animals,
for the C&oelig;lenterates have certainly retained many of the characters
which were possessed by the direct ancestors of man, such, for
instance, as the simple digestive cavity, the primitive type of body,
consisting of two cell layers, the diffuse and elementary nervous
system, and the radial arrangement of parts. Moreover, the
course of Evolution in the group, leading from the Hydra to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a><br /><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a><br /><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>sea-anemone and the Medusa, has probably been in many respects
parallel to that which started from some primitive extinct form,
and led up to the Ctenophora. Therefore the study of the group
has thrown much light on the earlier history of the animal world.
Regarding the age of the group, it may be mentioned that fossil
corals, etc., are found, along with Crustaceans and Molluscs, in
the earliest known fossil-bearing beds, belonging to the Cambrian
age.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE WORMS AND SOME OF THEIR POSTERITY</p>


<p>The somewhat miscellaneous collection of animals that have
been thrown together and termed <em>worms</em> is of the greatest importance
for our theory of descent. Indeed, it seems probable that
all of the four great groups which we have yet to mention have
descended directly from worm ancestors. This, at all events,
is the view of Haeckel, although it must be admitted that many
other theories have been proposed. Nor can it be taken as a
matter for surprise that agreement concerning this part of our
history should be hard to reach, for the difficulties which are met
in it are many and perplexing.</p>

<p>The worms comprise many greatly divergent groups, and the
difference between the lowest and the highest of these has been
produced by many important steps in Evolution. Of these
groups but few immediately concern us; the first and lowest of
those which do, is that of the Turbellarians, a section of the
Platodes or flat-worms. The Turbellarians are small or microscopic
tongue-shaped organisms, of which the majority of species
live on the sea-floor, others however being found in fresh water.
The surface of the body is covered uniformly with cilia, which
serve, in the smaller forms, as organs of propulsion, while in the
larger they appear to have the function of maintaining a flow of
fresh water over the surface, and thus of assisting respiration.
In some respects there has been little advance from the condition
of the C&oelig;lenterate. The digestive cavity is a simple or more or
less divided sac, communicating with the exterior only by means
of the mouth. Unlike the condition of affairs in the C&oelig;lenterates
and Ctenophora, however, the sex glands do not discharge the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
reproductive bodies into the digestive cavity, but directly to the
exterior by means of a special opening. Each individual has a
pair of male and a pair of female reproductive glands, but the
eggs are not self-fertilised; nor is the fertilisation of the eggs
trusted to chance and the sea-water, as in the lower groups.
Instead there is a definite exchange of sperms between two individuals,
and the eggs are fertilised before they leave the body.
They are also frequently supplied with a store of nutritive material
by a pair of special yolk glands. A distinct step of progress can
thus be recognised in the arrangements for reproduction. Between
the outer skin and the inner digestive layer is developed a considerable
mass of cells, forming muscular and connective tissue,
etc. It will readily be understood that the development of such
thick tissue masses occasions two distinct new difficulties in the
animal economy; for where cells are in direct contact neither
with the digestive layer nor with the exterior, their nutrition
and the removal of their waste products can no longer be efficiently
carried on without special devices. Hence on the one hand a
circulatory system, for the transport of food materials, and on
the other an excretory system, become necessary. The first of
these new departures was not destined to be made until the next
stage of progress; the Turbellarians seem to have temporarily
got over the difficulty, like the Ctenophora, by developing a complex
and ramifying digestive cavity. An excretory system,
however, makes its appearance here. Indeed, the beginnings of
such a system can be seen in the Ctenophora, in which there are
small excretory organs opening into the digestive cavity. The
corresponding organs in the worms, as in all subsequent types,
open directly to the outside. In the Turbellarians these organs,
which are termed nephridia, are two in number, and consist of
long tubes which branch and ramify throughout the body, the
small branches terminating in special excreting cells, and the
whole constituting a complete and thorough drainage system.
The nervous system consists of one or two small masses of nerve
cells termed ganglia in the front region, with a somewhat complex
network of nerves connecting them with various parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
body. There are frequently two pairs of sense organs, probably
rudimentary eyes and ears respectively. The main features of
the digestive, reproductive, excretory, and nervous system are
shown in the figures in Fig. 40.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

    glands.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The Turbellarians probably arose from Ctenophora or from
some nearly related form, a
view that receives support from
the occurrence of several apparently
intermediate types.
The differences may, in fact,
be partly accounted for as
adaptations to meet the change
of habitat from that of the
upper waters to that of the
sea floor. A spherical, or pear,
or bell shape is suitable enough
for a swimming animal, but
would be impossible for one
that was to crawl. The first
change, then, we may imagine,
was a flattening, which produced
a disc-shaped animal,
with the mouth in the centre
of the lower aspect and the
sense organs in the middle of
the upper. Secondly, a definite
mode of progression, by which
one part of the body continually
went first, would be an advantage,
as permitting of a better
co-ordination of movements,
and an elongation of the body in the line of movement would have
the effect of diminishing resistance and of making progression
easier. Finally the sense organs, like the scouts of an army,
would be best in front, and would migrate thither, and the mouth,
in order to get the full benefit of the food which the sense organs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
sought out, would gradually shift to a position beside them.
These adaptions, it is obvious, have produced a complete change
in the architecture of the animal. Our sea-anemone, or Medusa,
or Ctenophore is <em>radially symmetrical</em>. That is to say, its parts
are arranged like the spokes of a wheel, and it may be divided
into two equal halves by each of
several planes passing through the
main axis. It has an upper and a
lower surface, but no head and tail
ends. The lowest of the worms
now can be divided into two halves
only in one direction, that which
separates the right and left sides.
They are, in scientific language,
<em>bilaterally symmetrical</em>. The change
to this type of architecture was
a very important step of Evolution,
particularly in relation to
locomotion. Bilateral symmetry
was destined to remain a constant
feature of three of the four great
groups that evolved from the
worms. The star-fishes reverted
to the earlier condition.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The next class of worms with
which we have to deal is that of
the Rotifera. In their general
structure, and in their excretory
and sensory-nervous systems, the
Rotifers do not differ essentially
from the Turbellarians. They do differ, however, in that the
digestive cavity has a second opening to the exterior, at the
end opposite to the mouth. The advantage of this arrangement,
which was retained in the subsequent stages of Evolution,
is obvious, for it renders possible a much more regular and
thorough digestive process. Instead of the food passing in, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the undigested remains passing out, by the same opening, and
instead of the contents of the digestive cavity being a general
mixture of food material in all stages of digestion, there is now a
regular stream of food passing through the cavity in one direction,
and being digested as it goes. A near relative of the Rotifers is
shown in Fig. 42.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Thirdly, we must briefly allude to the Nemertines. These
are a group of flattened thread-like worms of very variable size,
found both in fresh and salt water. The most notable advance
in this group is to be seen in the occurrence of a special circulatory
system. It has already been indicated that the gastric cavity of
the lower forms has the double function of digestion and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
transport of nutritive substances to the various parts of the body.
In the Nemertines the second of these functions is carried out
by the blood system, which consists of two or three vessels that
run parallel throughout the length of the body and anastomose
at either end. There is no indication of any enlarged or specially
contractile portion of any of these, no indication, that is to say,
of a heart. The blood conveys not only nutritive substances,
but also, as in the higher animals, oxygen. Some Nemertines
have indeed red blood, containing true hæmoglobin, which is
well known as the oxygen-carrying material in the vertebrates.
A typical Nemertine is shown in Fig. 44, and a diagram showing
some features of the anatomy in Fig. 45. It will be seen that the
nervous system is of the same type as in the worms already described.
There are two pairs of sense organs, one pair being eyes,
and the other probably having the function of gauging the chemi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>cal
nature of the water. The Nemertines possess a peculiar
organ in a snout or proboscis, which they can protrude or withdraw
into a special sac. The snout is armed with a sharp sting, and
forms an effective weapon whether against the creature's enemies
or its prey.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 43.</span>&mdash;Nephridium of a Turbellarian.</p></div>
</div>

<p>About this stage of Evolution, the exact point being somewhat
difficult to fix, there appears the body cavity. This, which
is altogether distinct from the digestive cavity, is a familiar
feature of the anatomy of the higher animals. In it are suspended
the heart and lungs and the whole of the digestive organs and
glands. The question of the origin of the body cavity and the
blood system is a very difficult one, and a thorough theoretical
discussion would take us too far.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to the question of the origin of the vertebrates,
we may pause briefly to consider the other groups to
which the worms appear to have given rise. First of these we
may take the Echinoderms, which include the well-known star-fishes
and sea-urchins, and the very beautiful feather stars. As
already indicated, it is believed that the radial symmetry, which
is so characteristic of this group, is not a primitive feature, but
that, in fact, the Echinoderms are descended from bilaterally
symmetrical ancestors. One reason for this view is that the
larval or immature form is always markedly bilaterally symmetrical.
In an ordinary star-fish, which we may take as typical
of the group, the mouth is in the middle of the lower aspect, and
the excretory opening of the digestive cavity in the upper side
just opposite. There is no blood system, or excretory organs,
and no concentration of nerve cells into any form of brain. Eyes,
however, are present, and sensitiveness to light may be easily
demonstrated. The most remarkable feature of the group is the
water-vascular system, consisting of a series of radial canals,
one in each ray, which join a circular one situated in the central
portion of the body. The system of canals communicates with
the exterior by means of a sieve-like plate on the upper surface,
and it is kept full of water by the continual pumping action of
cilia on the walls of the tube which leads down from the sieve plate.</p>

<p>The ordinary star-fish is carnivorous,
and lives largely on
ordinary mussels, which it
bridges over with its arms, and
opens by a steady and long-continued
pulling, the soft
parts being then sucked up by
the partially protruded stomach.
A few types of Echinoderms
are shown in Figs. 46,
47, 48.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The group of the Mollusca
includes such common forms as
cuttle-fishes, whelks, slugs,
snails, mussels, and oysters.
These, it will be observed, comprise
marine, freshwater, and
land forms. The molluscs, like
the next two groups with which
we have to deal, have made a
conquest of the land, though in the present instance it cannot
be regarded as very complete.
The anatomy of the
group shows much variation,
and only a few of the leading
features can be alluded to.
The digestive system is
highly developed. The
mouth is provided with a
jaw or jaws, and with a
tongue-like ribbon, which is
covered with rows of teeth,
like a file, and by whose
action the food is torn and
disintegrated. A gullet leads
from the mouth to a stomach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
which is followed by an intestine. Salivary glands and a large
hepatic gland or liver are present. Respiration occurs partly
through the skin, but special organs also exist for this function, gills
in the water forms, and a lung cavity in those which breathe air.
There is a well-developed blood system, and generally a heart; the
blood is pumped direct from the heart to the general body tissues,
and returns to it by way of the kidneys or nephridia, which purify
it of waste materials, and the respiratory organs, where it is freed
of carbon dioxide and supplied with oxygen. The nervous
system varies greatly, but a pair of cerebral ganglia&mdash;a brain&mdash;is
usually present. There is a particularly keen sense of smell,
and taste and hearing may also easily be shown to exist. Some
forms are blind, from which condition there is a regular series of
stages of development of the eye, up to forms in which it becomes
a highly perfected organ, with cornea, iris, lens, and retina. The
close similarity between this and the ordinary vertebrate eye,
which must have evolved quite separately, is one of the strangest
coincidences of Evolution. Thus in many ways the molluscs are
to be regarded as highly specialised types. But in two important
directions, in intelligence and in their arrangements for locomotion,
they stand as a group on a low plane of development.
Figs. 49, 50, and 51 illustrate some of the forms met with in
the group. The origin of the molluscs, as well as that of the
Echinoderms, is wrapped in obscurity. That each group is
derived from some form of worm is probable, yet some zoologists
hold even such a general statement as this to be lacking in
support.</p>

</div>

<p>Our third great group is that of the Arthropods (literally
'jointed footed'), including the Crustaceans (crabs, lobsters,
shrimps, etc.), spiders and mites, centipedes and insects. The
Arthropods are sometimes classed together with their ancestors,
the ringed worms (such as the common earth-worm), as Articulata,
a name which refers to a very obvious feature, the repetition of
similar segments in a regular series from front to rear. This
is perhaps most apparent in the ringed worms and centipedes,
but it is to be seen in all members of the group. This same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a><br /><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a><br /><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>tendency to reduplication of parts in a regular series may be
observed in the vertebrates, as we shall see. Slight indications
of it are also to be found in the Nemertines. Numerous theories
have been proposed which derive the vertebrates from some of
the Articulata&mdash;from the ringed worms or the Crustaceans, and
even from the air-breathing members; and at first sight such
theories seem attractive, for in some of their more obvious
characters there is a certain resemblance between the two groups.
But there are also many and fundamental differences, and few
zoologists have accepted any hypothesis of this type. We may
briefly allude to some of these differences.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>In the Arthropods, where the body consists of hard and soft
parts, the 'skeleton' is an external one, and encloses the soft
parts. Respiration occurs by means of the skin or of gills, or,
in air-breathing forms, by 'trachea,' which are small branching
tubes opening on the sides of the body. But in no case has the
mouth or the digestive tract any connection with the respiratory
system, a condition of affairs very different from that obtaining
in the vertebrates. The nervous system consists of a brain,
situated above the gullet, a nerve ring round the latter, and a
double nerve cord running along the body, <em>below</em> the digestive
canal. This is obviously the opposite position to that occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
by the main nerve cord in the vertebrates, an important point
of difference.</p>

<p>The Arthropods are an extraordinarily successful group. A
multitude of forms of Crustaceans populate the waters, and they
are excelled in numbers and variety only by the insects upon
land. While the individual size appears to be somewhat strictly
limited, probably by the nature of the respiratory and blood
systems, many types show exceedingly high development in
various directions&mdash;in intelligence, in social and parental instincts,
etc. The insects are of course to be regarded as the highest
Articulata, and have, like the highest vertebrates, the mammals
and birds, almost completely forsaken the water for the dry land
and the air. An interesting member of the Articulata, from
the standpoint of the Evolution theory, is the Peripatus, shown
with a ringed worm on Fig. 52 (3). It gains its interest for us
from the fact that, while classed as an Arthropod, it stands very
nearly half-way between the ringed worms (Fig. 52 (1)) and the
true Arthropoda, and thus forms a solitary link between the two
types. In Fig. 52 (2) and Figs. 53 to 58 are shown a number of
types of Arthropods.</p>

</div>

<p>We must now go back and take up the main thread of our
story. The next stage that falls to be described is that of a
highly interesting group of worms known as Enteropneusta, a
name signifying 'gut breathers.' This group contains a very
small number of worm forms, which are to be found burrowing
in the sand of the sea floor. A typical example is the Balanoglossus,
a worm of some four inches in length, whose general
appearance is illustrated in Fig. 59. The creature has, as will
be observed, a large muscular snout or proboscis, behind which
follows a small portion called the collar, and behind this again
the long body. The most noteworthy feature of the group, as
the name implies, is the respiratory system. The mouth, which
is situated in the region of the 'collar,' leads into a gullet, which
is partially divided into an upper and a lower canal by means of
two inwardly projecting longitudinal folds, one on either side.
Only the lower of these canals is used as a food passage; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a><br /><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a><br /><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a><br /><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a><br /><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>upper communicates with the outside by means of a large number
of transverse slits on its sides. Water is continually being taken
in by the mouth and passed along this upper canal, to reach the
outside by way of the gill slits, and in doing so it passes over the
gills, where the blood is circulating in fine capillary vessels.
Here the blood is supplied with
oxygen from the water, and is at
the same time relieved of carbonic
oxide. This, it will be observed,
is the same method of respiration
as that of the fishes. Behind the
last gill slit the digestive canal
becomes a simple tube, with two
digestive glands or liver sacs.
There are two main blood vessels,
the larger running along above the
digestive canal, and the smaller
below it, the two being connected
by means of numerous branches.
There is a swelling of the dorsal
vessel&mdash;a heart&mdash;at its forward extremity,
in the base of the proboscis.
The nervous system is
peculiar; it consists of two nerve
cords, the smaller below the gut
and the larger above it&mdash;the latter
therefore occupying a position similar
to that of the spinal cord in
the vertebrates. Thus in two
respects, in its respiratory and nervous systems, Balanoglossus
must be regarded as a highly extraordinary member of the
worm group, and in both its peculiarities it shows an approach
to the vertebrate. There can be little doubt as to the position
of this group as an important connecting link between the ordinary
worms and the vertebrates. Fig. 60 illustrates the main features
of the anatomy.</p>

<p>As to the origin of the Enteropneusta, opinions are somewhat
divided. Their blood system and their development would seem
to suggest a descent from the ringed worms. On the other hand,
their possession of a snout, and their very slight indication of
division into segments, would seem to separate them from the
group mentioned and to connect them rather with the Nemertines.
The latter view is perhaps the more probable.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE EARLY VERTEBRATES AND THE FISHES</p>


<p>The lowest of the vertebrates&mdash;if indeed it can be called a vertebrate
at all, seeing that it has no vertebræ&mdash;is the lancelet,
Amphioxus. The common species of this animal (there are some
eight in all) occurs in the sea off our own coasts, and is usually
to be found half buried in the sand or mud of the sea floor. It is
some two inches in length and has the shape of a laterally flattened
cigar, and one of its very obvious features is the arrangement of
the muscles in regular layers from front to back, in the same
manner as those of a fish.</p>

<p>To describe some of its features in detail, the alimentary canal
bears a somewhat striking similarity to that of Balanoglossus.
There is a round, simple mouth, unprovided with jaws, and surrounded
by a number of projecting bristles. This leads into a
large pharynx, through the walls of which, on either side, pass a
large number of gill slits. The pharynx is not divided into an
upper and a lower canal, but there is a shallow groove along the
bottom which serves the same purpose as the food canal in Balanoglossus.
The remaining, digestive, part of the gut is practically
a simple tube, with a blind sac attached, representing the liver.
The gill slits do not open directly to the exterior, but into the
so-called peribranchial chamber, formed by the junction below
the body of two flap-like outgrowths, one from the upper part of
either side. This chamber opens to the outside by a single pore.</p>

<p>Above the gut lies a straight, cylindrical rod of cartilage,
pointed at either end. This is the highly important structure
known as the <em>Notochord</em>, which is present in all the vertebrates,
although in the higher forms it is replaced during development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
by the vertebræ, the bony segments of the backbone. Above
the notochord again lies the main nerve cord, a position which
it retains throughout the whole vertebrate group. The nerve
cord is simple in structure, with only a very slight swelling at the
front end, representing the brain. There are two main blood
vessels, an upper and a lower, which expand and contract alternately
throughout their whole length, and thus maintain the
circulation. The blood passes forward in the ventral vein, is
pumped through the fine vessels of the gills, and collected into the
upper artery. From this it is distributed throughout the body
by branch vessels, to be re-collected into the ventral vein. If the
reader will refer to the illustrations in Figs. 61, 62, and 63,
the relationships of these parts will be more easily understood.
There is a single small eye-spot, a single organ of smell, but no
hearing organs. It seems probable that this extremely ill-developed
condition of the sensory system is due in some measure
to degeneration, and is not a primitive characteristic. There are
numerous pairs of simple nephridia, which open into the peribranchial
chamber, and bear a close resemblance to those of the
worms.</p>

<p>The lancelet forms a most important link between the lower
and the higher animals. It is in all probability derived from some
form similar to Balanoglossus, and it certainly leads up to the
round-mouths, which form the next step in the ladder.</p>

</div>

<p>Before describing these latter, however, we must briefly allude
to the highly remarkable group of the tunicates or sea squirts,
one of which is shown in Fig. 64. They are sedentary creatures
found attached to rocks or weeds on the sea floor, and in appearance
they remind one rather of misshapen potatoes than of higher
animals. They are in fact regarded by the fishermen who bring
them to the surface as plants, and they were for long looked upon
by zoologists as akin to the molluscs. The only definite external
features of the tunicates are two apertures at the upper end, one in
the centre and one somewhat on one side. The absence of any other
definite external characters is due to the fact that the creature is
enclosed in a mantle of cellulose. The central opening is the mouth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a><br /><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a><br /><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a><br /><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a><br /><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>which leads into a large pharynx, the walls of which are perforated
by numerous gill slits. This is
surrounded by the mantle cavity,
which connects with the outer
water by means of the second pore.
The gut is continued into a simple
stomach and intestine, the latter
bending back upon itself and opening
into the bottom of the mantle cavity,
as shown in the diagram in Fig. 63.
In the adult animal there is no trace of
the notochord, and only a remnant of
the nerve cord; and there are either no
special sense organs or only traces of
these. On the other hand, the tunicates
possess a centralised heart. They
are hermaphrodite, and, very curiously,
a number of forms multiply like corals,
by a simple process of budding.</p>

</div>

<p>Now the remarkable fact has been
made out that the young tunicate (see
Fig. 65) bears a most striking resemblance
to the immature lancelet.
It is a free-swimming, tadpole-like creature, and possesses a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
notochord and nerve cord and in general the same characters
that we described for Amphioxus. It is only later that the
creature settles down and assumes its final degenerate sedentary
form. There can be no doubt that the tunicates have
been derived from some lancelet-like form, but the course of
their evolution has been unique. The type is the lost brother
of the vertebrate family, who has chosen a distinctly downward
path in life; yet who has come to no miserable end, but lives
on, more or less successfully, in his lower social sphere.</p>

<p>The round-mouths, including the lampreys and the hag-fish,
stand midway between the lancelet and the fishes, and therefore
constitute for us an important group.</p>

<p>The lamprey is a fairly generally known eel-like creature,
of which there is a smaller fresh-water, and a larger salt-water
species, the latter reaching a length of about a yard. It is found
attached to, and feeding on, the dead bodies of fish, and less
frequently on living specimens. The hag is much more definitely
parasitic in its habits, and often occurs in the body cavity
of living fish. These forms were for long regarded as fishes,
and are sometimes even yet included in that group, but all
their characteristics point to a very much lower position in
the animal world than such a classification would indicate.
One of the most striking external differences is that the
round-mouths have nothing to represent the two pairs of
fins which occur uniformly in the fishes, and which are, in a
true sense, the forebears of our own arms and legs. Even
more important than this is the absence of jaws. The mouth in
this group is a simple round opening, whose edges are armed with
pointed teeth, the latter, however, bearing no real resemblance
to the teeth of the higher animals. By means of these teeth, and
a pointed, tongue-like organ, and by suction, the round-mouths
are able to bore into the tissues of the animals on which they prey.
The absence of jaws and of extremities is, of course, a feature
which they share with the lancelet. Turning to the internal
structure, we may first observe that there is still no vertebral
column, but only a simple, rod-like notochord, similar in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
shape, and in its relations to other parts, to that of Amphioxus.
There is, however, an additional development of cartilage
in the region of the head, forming, in particular, a sheath-like
covering for the brain and also a kind of basket-work
support for the pharynx and gills. The original tube-like
form of the dorsal nerve cord is easily recognisable, but it
is distinctly distended at its front end into a brain, which
shows a division into a series of three distinct portions, called
respectively the fore, mid, and hind brain. This division, it
is interesting to observe, is the first process in the development
of the brain in all the higher animals. There is a pair of well-developed
hearing organs, and in the lamprey a pair of similarly
well-developed eyes. In the hag fish the latter are greatly
reduced, a condition which is explained by the creature's mode
of life. The nostril is unpaired, a condition which is probably
primitive. Respiration is carried out by means of gills, which are
situated in a series of six to eight pouches, each of which opens into
the gullet and again directly to the outside, the external openings
being an obvious feature of the animal. There is a very distinct,
simple heart, which pumps the blood to the gills, from whence
it is collected and distributed throughout the body. The
digestive canal is a simple tube, provided, however, with a liver
and a pancreas, the two most important digestive glands in the
higher animals. The sexes are separate, but traces of a previous
hermaphrodite condition seem to persist. Henceforward in the
vertebrate group the sexes are always separate. A character of
the sex organs which is to be regarded as primitive is that they
are unconnected with the excretory system, whereas in the higher
vertebrates the two systems are always strangely interconnected.
As in all the higher types, there is but one pair of male or female
reproductive glands. Finally, the round-mouths differ markedly
from the lancelet in the structure of the skin. In the latter animal
the skin is composed of a single layer of cells. In the former it
consists of an epidermis, some three or four layers thick, and an
underlying cuticle or 'true skin'; in other words, the skin has
the same general structure as that of the higher types. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
lamprey and the hag are illustrated in Figs. 66 and 67, and some
of the main anatomical features of the group are shown in Figs.
63, 68, and 69.</p>

</div>

<p>There remain, even after the most thorough investigation of
Balanoglossus, the lancelet, and the round-mouths, some questions
with regard to the origin of the vertebrates that are still unanswered.
It must, however, be regarded as an extremely
fortunate circumstance that representatives have come down to us
of the three ancient groups to which these three types respectively
belong. This is the more fortunate in that the groups in question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
are known only from their few living members, a circumstance
which is of course easily accounted for by the absence of any hard
parts capable of being preserved as fossils. From this point
onwards there is a skeleton, and we are consequently enabled to
draw valuable information from fossils. Partly in consequence
of this, the Evolution chain from this point onwards is much more
complete than the portion that we have dealt with thus far.</p>

</div>

<p>We have already observed that the true fishes, to which we
must now direct our attention, differ from the round-mouths in
several important characters. They possess two pairs of extremities,
the pectoral and pelvic fins; they have a pair of nostrils;
there is also a well-developed skull, which includes a series of
cartilaginous or bony arches situated in the wall of the gut and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
between the successive gill clefts. These branchial arches bear a
certain resemblance to the basket-work arrangement of cartilage
in the round-mouths, but for various reasons are not regarded as
having been derived from the latter. It is from the first pair of
these arches that the jaws are formed, organs which make their
first appearance in the lower fishes. The skeleton shows great
development in other directions. The notochord is present in
its primitive condition during the earlier stages of development,
but it becomes surrounded, and in many cases largely suppressed,
by the portions of the vertebræ. Each
vertebra consists of an upper and a lower
portion, the upper forming an arch round
the nerve cord and the lower bearing
lateral processes or ribs. In the higher
forms the two portions become united
round the notochord, and the resulting
vertebra may encroach inwards until it
becomes solid, the notochord then remaining
only as a series of small pieces of
cartilage between the successive units of
the vertebral column. There is also, of
course, a skeleton in connection with the
limbs, but this does not yet correspond in
detail to that of the other classes of vertebrates.
The brain is much more highly
developed than in the round-mouths; in
many forms, particularly, there is a considerable development of the
cerebral hemispheres, a portion of the fore brain, and the seat of the
higher intelligence. The eyes and ears show the same main features
as in the higher groups. The ear has three semicircular canals, the
same number as in man, as against two in the lamprey and one in
the hag. Fishes are possessed of a peculiar 'sixth sense,' the
organs for which are situated in two lines running along the sides
of the body, the latter forming a familiar feature of a cod or
whiting. The nature of this sense is not definitely known, but it
appears to be of the nature of a very refined appreciation of wave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a><br /><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a><br /><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>motions in the water. It is probably by means of these 'lateral
line' sense organs, for instance, that fishes are so easily able to
avoid obstacles when swimming in the dark.</p>

</div>

<p>The heart has one auricle and one ventricle, except in a single
group which we shall afterwards mention. The heart is situated
immediately behind the gills, to which the blood is pumped
directly by the ventricle. From the gills, the blood is collected
and distributed throughout the body, is re-collected and returned
to the auricle. The circulatory system is provided with a set of
blood-glands, essentially similar to those in man himself. There
is a spleen, a thymus and a thyroid gland, and a pair of suprarenal
bodies. The several functions of these glands form an
extremely difficult chapter of physiology, but, broadly speaking,
they are concerned in the formation of the white blood corpuscles,
the removal of worn-out red corpuscles, and in certain obscure but
important chemical changes in the composition of the blood.
The blood itself consists of a fluid plasma in which float white
and red blood corpuscles, the latter being flat and oval, and containing
the same oxygen-carrying substance, hæmoglobin, as is
found in mammals.</p>

<p>The alimentary canal is simple. The mouth cavity is succeeded
by the pharynx, the walls of which are perforated by the
gill clefts. Next follow the gullet, the stomach, and the intestine,
the division into the three portions being apparent often only
after close examination. There are generally gastric glands, of
simple form, a large liver, and almost always a pancreas. The
kidneys and the reproductive organs open to the exterior by a
common duct. A further characteristic feature of the fishes is their
external covering of scales. True teeth, comparable to those of the
higher vertebrates, appear first in this group. Some of the main
features that we have mentioned are illustrated in Fig. 70.</p>

<p>Careful study of the fishes makes it evident that they have
very much in common with the higher groups of vertebrates.
It is not too much to say, with Haeckel, that there is far more
difference between Amphioxus and the fishes than between the
fishes and man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>There are four main divisions of the fish group. The first,
that of the Elasmobranchs, comprises the sharks and dog-fishes,
the skates and the rays. The second group, the Ganoids, includes
the sturgeon and a few less well-known forms. The third, the
so-called bony or food fishes, includes the vast majority of ordinary
species, such as the salmon and trout, the cod, herring, eel, and
all our ordinary freshwater species. The fourth, the 'lung
fishes,' consists of three very remarkable species, which we shall
later describe in detail. The mutual relationships of these groups
is well understood, and it is possible to make fairly definite statements
regarding their evolution.</p>

<p>The Elasmobranchs are at once the most primitive and,
so far as is known, the oldest of the four. From these evolved
the lower Ganoids, which then divided into two main branches,
the first of which led up to the higher Ganoids and through them,
at a comparatively late date, to the bony fishes. The second
led to the lung fishes and, either through them or along a somewhat
parallel line, to the amphibians and the land vertebrates
generally. It is with the second line, therefore, that we shall
be mainly concerned.</p>

<p>The Elasmobranchs are characterised by the fact that the gill
slits open individually to the exterior, there being no gill cover,
such as is found in the other groups. Their scales are simple,
tooth-like projections, and in fact there is no essential difference
between them and the teeth. The skull is more primitive than in
the other groups, but a discussion of its details would necessarily
be very involved. The living members of the group show a fairly
high stage of development of the vertebræ&mdash;considerably higher,
in fact, than that found in the lung fishes&mdash;but some extinct
members showed a very primitive condition with regard to this
point. In the fossil skeleton shown in Fig. 71, for instance, it
is apparent that the notochord was present as a simple continuous
rod. The skeleton in question is from the Permian and belongs
to what is regarded as the most primitive type of fish known.
Two specimens of Elasmobranchs are shown in Figs. 72 and 73,
and the teeth of a shark in Fig. 74.</p>

<p>In the Ganoids and bony fishes there is a gill cover, and in all
but a few Ganoids there is some formation of true bone, whereas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
in the Elasmobranchs the skeleton is wholly cartilaginous. One
of the most striking anatomical features of these groups, and one
which distinguishes them from the Elasmobranchs, is the presence
of a swim bladder, a large sac-like outgrowth from the upper part
of the gut. The function of the swim bladder is that of regulating
the specific gravity of the fish, which becomes greater or less
according as air is expelled or taken in. The Ganoids and bony
fishes are illustrated in Figs. 75 to 79.</p>

<p>The lung fishes or Dipnoi present a curious mixture of primitive
and of highly advanced characters. In their persistent
notochord and their inconsiderable formation of bone, they are
much more primitive than the food fishes. On the other hand,
an extremely important departure is seen in the adaption of the
swim bladder as a respiratory organ. In one of the three existing
species this organ is single, in the others it is double. The wall
of the swim bladder is thick, and contains considerable muscle
tissue. Its inner surface is covered with a complex system of
pits and blind sacs, the walls of which contain numerous capillary
vessels.</p>

<p>There are three living species of lung fishes, one of which
is found in Australia, another in Tropical Africa, and a third in
the tributaries of the Amazon. All live under conditions which
make ordinary respiration by gills difficult. The Australian
species inhabits rivers which become reduced, in the dry season,
to stagnant pools of foul water, in which ordinary fish frequently
fail to survive. Under such circumstances the creature comes
periodically to the surface to breathe. The other two species
live in rivers which actually dry up in summer, and the fishes bury

air by their lungs, until the rainy season comes round, perhaps
four or even six months later. Correlated with the special
method of respiration is a special type of blood system, whereby
part of the blood is pumped direct to the lungs, and returns
direct to the heart. There are two auricles, to receive the
blood from the lungs and the general circulation respectively,
but only one ventricle, in which the two streams become
mixed. Figs. 80 to 82 illustrate the three existing Dipnoi, and
the structure of the lung is shown in Fig. 83.</p>

<p>It is obvious, from the distribution of the lung fishes, and also
from geological evidence, that the group was once very plentifully
represented, and has only been preserved from total extinction
by peculiar circumstances.</p>

<p>Regarding the position of the group, some zoologists regard
them as the direct ancestors of the Amphibians. Others believe
that the group had a common origin with the bony fishes and
the Amphibia in some early form of Ganoid. In any case, the
Dipnoi possess an extraordinary interest as showing the beginnings
of adaption to a life out of the water.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE CONQUEST OF THE LAND</p>


<p>The Amphibia are the oldest and the lowest group of vertebrates
that are able to lead an active existence on land, and the characters
which distinguish them most definitely from the fishes are all
to be interpreted as adaptions to the new mode of life. One of
the most obvious external differences between the two groups
is in the structure of the extremities, the fish having fins, while
the amphibian has limbs constructed on the same general lines
as our own arms and legs. The fish's fin is to be regarded as an
extremity with a very great number of fingers or toes. It has
the function of a paddle, and is obviously useless whether for
supporting or propelling the body on land. The first obvious
necessity for a land existence is some mechanism by which the
limb can be alternately pushed forward and, being fixed to some
solid object, drawn upon, so as to pull the body after it. A
different arrangement of bones and muscles, so as to give a much
more complex lever system than that of a fin, and some kind
of clawing arrangement at the end, were thus necessary. The
similarity in the limbs of all the land vertebrates is very striking,
as is indicated by the comparison of human and a frog's limbs
on Fig. 84. In each case there is a single bone in the upper
arm or thigh, which is attached to a bony girdle in the trunk.
There are two elements in the forearm and in the lower leg respectively,
below which, in either case, is a group of small bones
constituting a complex joint at the wrist or ankle. Then follows
the set of five bones in the foot or hand, to each of which is
attached a jointed finger or toe. We have no reason to believe
that this particular arrangement, and the particular number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a><br /><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a><br /><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>digits, was arrived at except by accident. Once arrived at,
however, the arrangement was adhered to with considerable
strictness. For although the number of digits is in some groups&mdash;in
the birds especially&mdash;reduced, the primary design is almost
always readily recognisable. The second function of the limb,
that of supporting the body, was developed very slowly. In the
amphibians and reptiles, and even in the lower mammals, the
legs are comparatively weak and sprawling, and the creature
crawls on the belly.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 85.</span>&mdash;Development of the Frog.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The second great change which required to be made was of
course in the method of breathing. An ordinary fish, when taken
out of the water, dies of suffocation, because its gills become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
inefficient for respiration as soon as they become dry. An entirely
new type of organ had therefore to be evolved, and this occurred
on the same lines as in the Dipnoi, by the development of a pair
of sacs from the upper part of the digestive canal, in which the
blood is made to circulate, and which are kept filled with air
taken direct from the atmosphere. It is of course very well
known that an ordinary amphibian is not a lung breather throughout
its whole life. The metamorphosis of a gill-breathing tadpole
into a lung-breathing frog, illustrated in Fig. 85, is a phenomenon
with which everyone is familiar. And this condition, in
which a change in the mode of life is made by each individual
in the course of its development, is the typical one. But the
modern amphibians include types ranging from completely water
to perfect land forms. Some, like the Austrian Olm (Fig. 86), are
gill breathers throughout their whole life. One which is normally
of this type, the Axolotyl, illustrated in Fig. 87, can be made
to acquire lungs and assume a land mode of life. Others, which
normally make the metamorphosis, can be prevented from doing
so by being confined to the water, and complete their life-histories
in the condition of gill breathers. In still other forms (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</i> the
C&oelig;cilians, Fig. 89) the change is made before the young creature
leaves the egg, and the independent life is commenced in the
condition of a land animal.</p>

<p>Correlated with the development of the lungs is a change in
the structure of the nostrils, from the condition of blind sacs, as
they occur in the fishes, to that of air passages, communicating
with the upper part of the alimentary canal, and thence with the
lungs.</p>

<p>The living forms of the Amphibia differ considerably from the
types which constituted the group in those long-distant ages when
it was in the heyday of its prosperity. The latter forms were
characterised especially by a system of armour-plating over the
head, which frequently extended under the breast and even covered
the greater part of the lower surface, and which appears to have
formed a protection against the multitude of sharks which
populated the waters in which the amphibians partly lived. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a><br /><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a><br /><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>armour-plated type has
long ago become extinct,
but it is in it, rather than
in the modern forms of
Amphibia, that we must
look for the direct ancestor
of man. A fossil of this
earlier group is shown on
Fig. 90.</p>

</div>

<p>Our next group in the
order of Evolution is that
of the reptiles, the main
differences between which
and the Amphibia are of
the nature of more complete
adaptions to a life on land.
The reptiles have in fact completed
the conquest of the land
which was undertaken by the
previous group, and many of
them, living as they do in dry
and hot deserts, are as independent
of the water as any
form of animal life. Thus whereas
the amphibian has a thin skin,
which is kept moist by the secretions
of numerous skin glands, the
reptile has a body-covering of
scales, which form an effective
protection against a too rapid
loss of moisture. Evidently with
the same object, the reptile egg
is enclosed in a hard and resistant
shell. Correlated with the change
in the skin is a much more perfect
development of the lungs, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
while the amphibian breathes to a considerable extent through
its thin moist skin, this method of assisting respiration is not
available to the reptile.</p>

<p>Again connected with the improvement of the respiratory
process, there is a partial development of a septum dividing the
ventricle or pumping chamber of the heart. The value of this
division of course lies in the fact that the purified and oxygenated
blood from the lungs is prevented from mixing with the venous
blood from the body. The course of the blood is from the body
to the right auricle, thence to the right ventricle, and thence to
the lungs. The pure blood from the lungs returns to the left
auricle, passes thence to the ventricle on the same side to be
pumped to the general circulation. The disadvantage of a single
ventricle, such as occurs in the Amphibia, and the advantage of
the regular double circulation, such as that in man, are sufficiently
obvious. The division of the ventricle into two chambers is
less complete in the lizards and snakes, very nearly perfect in
the crocodiles.</p>

<p>The reptiles, like the Amphibia, are 'cold blooded,' by which
is meant, not that their blood is necessarily cold, but that its
temperature varies with that of the surroundings, while that of
the blood of the mammals and birds is practically constant.</p>

<p>A very important feature of the reptiles, which they possess
in common with the mammals and the birds, is that the embryo
produces two membranous outgrowths called respectively the
amnion and the allantois, which completely envelop it, and which
have important functions in connection with nutrition, respiration,
and excretion during the period when the young creature is
enclosed in the egg. It is, of course, not until we reach the higher
mammals that these membranes assume their greatest importance.</p>

<p>For a considerable time in the world's history the reptiles
were the dominant vertebrate class, and in the chalk period
especially they were represented by a great variety of forms,
and by a number of species of colossal stature, one at least of which
was over a hundred feet long. In those times the reptiles were
by no means all condemned to crawl on their bellies, for they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a><br /><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a><br /><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>included a large number of marine forms, comparable to the
porpoises and whales among the mammals, and flying forms
whose aspect must have resembled, and been equally terrifying
with, that of our mythical dragons. A few reconstructions of
these are shown in Fig. 91.</p>

<p>All living reptiles, with a single exception, belong to the four
comparatively modern types of the lizards, snakes, tortoises, and
crocodiles, of which examples are illustrated in Figs. 92 to 95. None
of these are closely related to the mammals or birds. For the
common ancestor of all these types we must go back to some
primitive reptile form. Fortunately such a type is represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
at the present day in a single peculiar species found in New
Zealand, which bears the Maori name of the Tuatara. It was
formerly found commonly on the mainland, but is now confined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a><br /><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a><br /><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>to a few small islands in the Bay of Plenty, North Island, where
it enjoys Government protection. It is, as the illustration in
Fig. 96 shows, a lizard-like creature, and reaches a length of
about two feet. It lives in burrows near the shore, and feeds on
small animals that are left behind by the tide. The Sphenodon,
as zoologists have named it, has apparently been preserved
owing to the absence of competition by the mammals, and
by adopting the rather curious mode of life just described.
In all its features, but especially in the primitive condition
of its vertebræ, it is very much lower than any other living
reptile, and it connects the higher groups with the Amphibia.
Many closely related fossil species are known, one of which is
shown in Fig. 97.</p>

</div>

<p>To the lay mind the distinctions between the Amphibia and
the reptiles are not very obvious, and indeed in the older classifications
the former group was not separated from the latter. The
differences between a reptile and a bird, on the other hand, are
very striking. It might therefore be regarded as a matter for
surprise that zoologists now make the greater distinction between
the Amphibia and the reptiles, grouping the former in one great
class with the fishes, the latter in a second great section with the
birds. But in fact there are many fundamental points of agreement
between reptiles and birds, and it is impossible to doubt
that the latter have sprung from a reptilian stock. Indeed, a
most interesting connecting link is known, in the fossil Archiopteryx
shown in Fig. 98, of which only two specimens have
been found, and which is the only creature of its type of which
we have any record. In all its skeletal features, the Archiopteryx
is reptilian, and it would undoubtedly have been classed as a
new type of reptile but for the obvious and unmistakable traces
of feathers. From what particular class of reptiles the birds
have sprung is not known.</p>

<p>The birds have assumed the position of almost unquestioned
masters of the air, but like other great groups they show possibilities
of evolution in other directions wherever opportunity
offers, and types like the kiwi and the penguin shown in Figs. 100<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and 101 have forsaken their native element&mdash;the one for the land,
the other for the water.</p>

<p>The birds agree with the mammals in the development of a
four-chambered heart, in their warm blood, in their external
covering for the skin, and in the development of arrangements
and instincts for the parental care of the young. Their line of
Evolution has thus been to some extent parallel to that of the
mammals. On the other hand, they differ obviously in the structure
and function of their fore limbs, in the absence of a diaphragm,
and in their special methods for the care of the young, and there
can be no doubt that the two groups have had quite different
origins in the reptile class.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE MAMMALS AND MAN</p>


<p>The subject of our discussion is now narrowed down to the group
of the mammals. The mammals are characterised by two very
obvious features: a body-covering of hair, and a set of special
glands in the female which secrete milk for the nourishment of
the young. These are constant characters, and neither is ever
found in any other group. As to how the hair originated, nothing
definite is known; but (while there are certain difficulties in
regard to the theory) it is on the whole reasonable to suppose that
the mammalian hair arose, as the bird's feather undoubtedly
did, as a modification of the reptile's scale. The mammary
gland appears to represent a modification of other skin glands,
either of sweat glands or more probably of the oil glands which
exist in connection with the hairs.</p>

<p>Another important character, already mentioned at the end
of the last chapter, is the diaphragm, a muscular partition separating
the body cavity into a thoracic and an abdominal portion.
The diaphragm has important functions in connection with the
mechanism of breathing. By means of it the thoracic cavity
can be increased or diminished in size, and air thus drawn into
or expelled from the lungs. It is interesting to observe that a
similar partition, with the same function, occurs in the Crocodiles,
but this has different relations to the abdominal organs,
and has evidently evolved quite independently.</p>

<p>Very characteristic of the mammals are, further, their teeth, for
whereas the teeth of the reptiles are indefinite in number, and
generally very numerous, those of the mammal are relatively
few, and each species has a definite normal number. Moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the teeth of the reptile are all of a kind, and they may be replaced
almost any number of times during the animal's life, whereas
those of the mammal show differentiation according to their
respective functions, and are only once changed, that is, when
the milk teeth are replaced by the permanent set. The teeth of
the mammal are of four kinds: incisors, or chisel-like cutting teeth,
canines, which are especially well developed in carnivorous
species, and which are used in the tearing up of flesh, etc., and
two groups of grinders&mdash;premolars, which are replaced during
the animal's life, and molars, which occur only as permanent teeth.</p>

</div>

<p>The mammals in all probability arose from a particular group
of reptiles which flourished in the Permian and Triassic periods,
and which disappeared very shortly afterwards. These pass
under the name of the Theromorpha, and a typical specimen,
Pareiosaurus, is illustrated in Fig. 102. The skull of another,
illustrated in Fig. 103, shows distinct indications of a mammal-like
differentiation of the teeth. The Tritylodon, whose skull
is shown in Fig. 104, is an intermediate type between this group
and the mammals, some zoologists regarding it, as it were, as the
last reptile, others as the first of the mammals.</p>

<p>As to how the special mammalian features arose, or what
special conditions called them into existence, we are of course
without definite knowledge, for neither hair nor mammary glands
are recognisable in fossils. But it seems likely that the warm
blood and the hairy covering evolved in correlation with one
another, and as adaptions to meet a gradual cooling of the
climate. It is certain at all events that the present-day mammals
(and also the birds) are far better adapted for a cold environment
than the reptiles, which very easily get frozen to death;
and it is also known that ice periods occurred in South Africa,
where many fossil Theromorpha and the Tritylodon are found,
at the time when these creatures existed; both of which facts
support the theory indicated.</p>

<p>At the present time the mammals are the highest and on the
whole the most successful of the vertebrate groups. They include
the largest and strongest, the swiftest-footed and the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a><br /><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a><br /><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>intelligent of the animal kind. They show refinements of the
senses of sight, hearing, and smell such as are met with nowhere
else. They range from the Equator to the coldest regions of the
earth in which any food is to be found; they people alike the
forest and the plain, and have their representatives both in the
air and in the sea.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_127.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 105.</span>&mdash;The Australian Duck-mole or Duck-billed Platypus.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The most lowly of the mammals are the Monotremes, which
include the well-known Australian duck-mole or duck-billed
platypus, and two species of spiny ant-eaters, one of which is
found in Australia, the other in New Guinea. The two types are
shown in Figs. 105 to 107. The best-known and most striking fact
concerning these is that, like the birds and reptiles, and unlike
all other mammals, they lay eggs. Beyond this feature they
show many affinities with the reptiles, in their skeleton for example,
and particularly in their reproductive organs. Another
interesting fact is that the blood temperature, of the ant-eater at
least, is low, and varies considerably. It has been found to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
range between 80 and 93 degrees Fahrenheit, whereas all other
mammals, so far as is known, have a blood temperature between
97 and 105, and moreover one that is remarkably constant for
each species during normal health. The brain development and
the intelligence are also much lower than in other mammals,
though distinctly superior to those met with among the reptiles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
The method of rearing the young in the case of the ant-eater
(that of the duck-mole not being yet fully known) is that
the single egg is placed, as soon as it is laid, in the pouch under
the belly of the female. Here it hatches in a very short time,
and here the young animal remains for the first two or three
months of its life, being nourished by milk produced by the
mammary glands, which open into the pouch. It is certainly
owing to the absence of the competition of the higher mammals in
the regions where they are found, that these two creatures, so
interesting from the standpoint of Evolution, have been preserved
to us.</p>

</div>

<p>The next group, the Marsupials, is the lowest in which we get
the true mammalian characteristic of the bearing of living young.
For while occasional members of other groups, of the reptiles
especially, produce live young, the actual state of affairs is fundamentally
different. In these latter the egg is merely retained in
the genital duct until the young creature emerges. It is merely
hatched inside the body of the mother instead of outside. But
in the Marsupials the developing young receive nourishment from
the mother, during prenatal life, other than what is contained
in the yolk. This nourishment is obtained in the form of a
secretion from the wall of the uterus, there being as yet (with a
single partial exception) no real connection between mother and
young.</p>

<p>The peculiar method of nourishing and protecting the young
Marsupial after birth is of course well known. The young are
born in a very immature and helpless condition, and are placed
by the mother in her pouch. The mouth becomes permanently
attached to the nipple of the dam, and the young creature remains
thus for a considerable time, the milk being pumped into
it by the mammary gland rather than sucked in by the efforts
of the creature itself.</p>

<p>The Marsupials are further characterised by the possession
of an extra pair of bones in the pelvis, which function as supports
for the pouch; by the peculiar and primitive arrangement
of the reproductive organs; by their still poorly developed brain;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and by their generally large number of teeth, which reach a total
of fifty or fifty-two in some species, whereas forty-four is the
ordinary maximum number in the main mammal group. This
last is to be regarded as a character derived from the reptiles.</p>

</div>

<p>It is very interesting to observe how, in Australia, where
the Marsupials have been free from the competition of other
mammals, they have evolved along many of the same general
lines as the higher group. We have indeed no marsupial whales,
bats, or seals, but there is a mole, very similar in its appearance
and habits to our European species, and a carnivorous type which
closely resembles a wolf or jackal; again we have bandicoots,
occupying the same place in nature as our rabbits and other
rodents; tree-dwelling, squirrel-like forms; and kangaroos,
which compare in their mode of life, if not in their appearance,
with the cattle, deer, and antelopes of other countries. The Marsupials
are illustrated in Figs. 108 to 113. This group, so far as
can be judged from fossils, is considerably older than that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a><br /><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a><br /><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>the higher mammals, and everything points to some marsupial
type as a connecting link between the egg-laying Monotremes
and the placental mammals.</p>

</div>

<p>As has previously been indicated, the most important characteristic
of the third great group is a modification of the membranes
of the embryo to form a connection between it and the wall of the
uterus. The allantois develops as a highly vascular membrane,
the small blood vessels of which are brought into very close contact
with those in the wall of the uterus. So that, while the
blood of the mother does not actually mix with that of the child,
the two fluids are separated only by thin membranes, through
which nutritive substances easily pass. The broad advantage
of this is, of course, that the young animal passes the earlier
stages of its life inside the mother's body, where it is exposed to
a minimum of risk, is efficiently nourished, and from which it is
not sent forth into the world until it is tolerably well able to look
after itself.</p>

<p>We shall now ask the reader to conceive a primitive placental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
mammal type, and to consider briefly the relationships of the
various groups that have sprung from it. The group whose
evolution has been perhaps least progressive is that of the Edentates,
including the sloths, armadillos, and American ant-eaters
(Fig. 114). Then, on the one hand, we have the herbivorous
types, including the remarkable sea-cows (Fig. 115), the rodents
(Fig. 116), and the hoofed animals, leading up from such comparatively
primitive forms as the coneys (Fig. 117) to such
highly specialised types as the giraffe (Fig. 118). The other series
of groups are believed to be more nearly related to each other
than to the aforementioned, and the nearest approach to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a><br /><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a><br /><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>common ancestor, among modern mammals, is probably to be
found in the Insectivora (Figs. 119 and 120). Differing sharply
from the Insectivora in their possession of wings, but otherwise
closely similar, are the bats (Fig. 121). From this same
insectivor-like type have probably evolved the whales (Fig. 122),
the seals, etc. (Fig. 123), the carnivora (Fig. 124), and finally
the primates, leading up through the lemurs to the monkeys
and man. Thus merely indicating the many and devious roads
of mammalian Evolution, we turn again to the one particular
line that we set out to follow.</p>

</div>

<p>The Insectivora are by many of their features recognisable
as low types of placental mammals. They have a primitive
type of skull, and frequently show a rather marked similarity
between the several classes of teeth. The brain is relatively
ill-developed, reminding one rather strongly of the Marsupials,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and the hemispheres show little if any tendency to develop those
wrinkles and fissures which always accompany the higher type
of intelligence. Probably the most primitive member of the
whole group is the Centetes from Madagascar, shown in Fig. 119.
The hedgehog and the shrews are its best-known examples.
An interesting point regarding the hedgehog is that, like few
other mammals, it has persisted almost unchanged from early
tertiary times. It is thus to be regarded as a very antique type,
not only in its main features, but in its details.</p>

</div>

<p>The Lemurs are an interesting group, standing, as they do,
midway between the primitive placental forms and the monkeys.
Their special home, as already mentioned, is Madagascar, to
which some thirty-six of the fifty known species are confined, but
they occur also in Africa and in South-Eastern Asia. They are
arboreal and mostly nocturnal in habits, and their food consists
partly of fruit, etc., partly of insects. They were formerly much
more widely distributed, and many fossils have been unearthed,
for example, in North America. They show certain characters
of a distinctly primitive kind, such, for instance, as their habit of
hibernation. Their typical number of teeth is thirty-six, the same
as in the lower monkeys, but fossil forms are known which possessed
the full number of forty-four.</p>

<p>In their general build they show marked adaptation to their
arboreal life, and approach, some more and some less, the appearance
of the monkeys. The fore-limbs are considerably modified
from the condition in which they occur in ordinary mammals, in
which they are placed vertically under the body. They are
placed in a more lateral position, so that they can be moved
through greater angles, and extended over the head. In common
language, they are ceasing to be legs, and are becoming arms. As
in the monkeys, the thumb and the great toe are opposed to the
other digits so as to render the hand and foot more efficient as
grasping organs. Hence the Lemurs may be included with the
apes as 'Quadrumana,' or four-handed animals. The fingers
and toes either bear claws, as in the lower animals, or flattened
nails like those of the higher apes and man, many species possessing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a><br /><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a><br /><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>the two types of structures on different digits. The face is fox-like,
and lacks the human expression that is seen in the monkeys.
The brain shows considerable variation, being in some species
far more primitive, in others rather more highly developed, than
in the lower monkeys.</p>

</div>

<p>The history of the group has been very completely made out
from fossils, and it is possible to work back to forms which, apart
from their known subsequent evolution, could not be definitely
separated from the ancestors of other mammal groups. The
Lemurs are illustrated in Figs. 125 to 127.</p>

<p>The monkeys, to which we now turn, are divided into two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
groups, the American or Western and the Eastern or Old-World
types, each of which is definitely confined to the regions indicated
by the names. The Western apes (Figs. 128 and 129) are by
much the lower group of the two, and in fact they lead back to
fossil forms which cannot be definitely distinguished from the
Lemurs. They are a side branch of the monkey stem, but are in
all probability the nearest living representatives of the first of
our ape ancestors. They are characterised by a wide septum
between the nostrils, which makes the latter open in an outward
direction, a feature which enables them to be distinguished at
a glance from the other group. They have further a prehensile
tail, which is of much use in climbing, and generally thirty-six
teeth, or four more than the Old-World group. The lowest of
them are the well-known Marmosets, which have claws on all the
digits except the great toe, which last has a nail. These are
further characterised by the presence of four nipples, all other
monkeys having only two. Correlated with this feature, the
Marmosets normally bear two or three young at a birth, whereas
in all other apes one is the usual number.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 128.</span>&mdash;A Marmoset (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hapale jacchus</i>).</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Eastern monkeys have thirty-two teeth, the same number
as in man; the septum between the nostrils is narrow, so that
these open downwards and forwards; the tail is never prehensile
and is frequently absent. They include such well-known forms as
the baboons, the Gibraltar ape, the sacred Hanuman of India,
the Diana monkey (Fig. 130), and the comical-looking Nasalis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a><br /><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a><br /><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>(Fig. 131). These represent a further step towards the final climax
of the primate group.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 135.</span>&mdash;The Gorilla.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A special class has to be made for the four genera of Old-World
apes illustrated in Figs. 132 to 136. These are the Gorilla
and Chimpanzee, which are African in distribution, and the
Gibbon and Orang, which are Asiatic. They are termed the
Anthropoid or man-like apes, and there can be no question that
they are the nearest living relatives of the human species. This
is seen in their general build, which is man-like in a high degree;
by many similarities, even in the minutest details, in their skeleton
and muscular system; and by the fact that their brain, while
still greatly inferior to that of man, is by as much superior to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of any other animal. The voice is frequently well modulated,
and the expression of the emotions, whether by it or by the
countenance, is very man-like. The position of the group was
summed up by Huxley, after a most thorough investigation of
their anatomy, in these words: "Thus, whatever system of
organs be studied, the comparison of their modification in the
ape series leads to one and the same result&mdash;that the structural
differences which separate man from the Gorilla and Chimpanzee
are not so great as those which separate the Gorilla from the
lower apes." An interesting physiological proof of the close
relationship between the anthropoids and man has more lately
been discovered. It is found that the blood serum of any animal
destroys the blood corpuscles of any other when these are mixed
with it, except those of closely related species. Now the human
blood serum is destructive of the corpuscles of all the lower
animals, so far as is known, except those of the anthropoids.</p>

Gorilla, and Man.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From Huxley's <cite>Man's Place in Nature</cite>.</p></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>As regards the inter-relationships of the four species, it is
certain that the Gibbon is the lowest, and the nearest to the
common ancestor of the other three and of man. It has indeed
the man-like characteristic of walking in the erect position; but
it has thirteen or fourteen pairs of ribs, as against the normal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
twelve in man; it has long arms, like the lower Old-World apes,
and large canine teeth. It is further the smallest of the group,
and in habits the most like the lower monkeys.</p>

<p>The Gorilla and Chimpanzee are closely related. The Gorilla
is not only the largest ape of the four, but in shape and build the
most man-like, which is accounted for by the fact that it is less
strictly arboreal than the others, and confines itself largely to the
ground. Its skull is superficially much less human in appearance
than that of the Chimpanzee, due to the strongly developed crests,
which serve as attachments for the powerful muscles of the lower
jaw. The teeth of the Chimpanzee are more uniform in size,
and the skull smoother. There is a marked difference in temperament
between the two species, the Gorilla being fierce and gloomy
and quite untamable, while the Chimpanzee is of a pleasant and
lively disposition, and can, as is well known, be trained to wear
clothes, eat with a fork and knife, etc.</p>

<p>The Orang-Utan is found inhabiting forest ground in Borneo
and Sumatra, and living largely in trees, in which it builds nests
as temporary sleeping-places. It is a clumsy-looking animal,
supporting itself on the knuckles of its hands when travelling along
the ground, and moving but slowly. It has twelve pairs of ribs,
the same number as in man, and one fewer than in the Gorilla and
Chimpanzee.</p>

<p>Practically all the important anatomical distinctions between
man and the anthropoids are reducible to two causes: the change
from the arboreal existence to a life on the ground and in the
open country, and the great development of the intelligence.
When the change in the mode of life occurred, it is obvious that an
erect carriage would possess an advantage over the stooping gait
of the ape, in which it is neither definitely a biped nor a quadruped.
The erect position necessitated a better-developed heel, stronger
calf and hip muscles, and a more parallel position and stronger
development of the great toe. It also brought about a shortening
of the fore-arms and a widening of the pelvis. Much has been
made of the difference in the foot, between the condition of a
grasping organ, with an opposable great toe, and that seen in man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
But the change is just what we should devise in order to make the
foot stronger for propelling the body on the ground. Moreover,
the difference is more obvious than fundamental, and it is well
known that in armless persons, who develop the possibilities of
their feet, the latter members can still be turned into wonderfully
efficient 'hands.'</p>

(<em>L</em>) Chimpanzee; (<em>M</em>) European.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In brain development the anthropoids are, as already
mentioned, greatly inferior to man; in the Gorilla, the largest-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>brained
type, the cranial capacity never, so far as is known, exceeds
600 cubic centimetres, whereas the average in man is about 1500,
and the smallest known about 930. Apart from the difference in
size, however, there is a surprisingly close similarity between the
anthropoid and the human brains, which may be followed even in
the particular arrangement of the fissures. That the gap between
the two types in respect of the character in question is by no means
extraordinarily wide may be seen from Fig. 137, in which a
series of brains are depicted. The size of the hemispheres and
the wrinkling of their surface are the characters from which we
judge the brain development, and it is obvious that in these
respects the step from the lower monkeys to the Chimpanzee is
greater than that between the Chimpanzee and the lowest human
type. In the teeth also, as is shown on Fig. 138, there is a gradual
change from the lemur to the human type.</p>

<p>Thus there can be no reasonable doubt that man has evolved
from an ancestor which, if it existed to-day, we should without
hesitation class as an anthropoid ape. Could any doubt have
remained, it would have been set aside by the discovery, in 1891,
of a being occupying a position about midway between the highest
apes and the most primitive known man. This is the Pithecanthropus,
whose remains were discovered in Java in a volcanic
deposit of somewhat doubtful age, but probably belonging to an
era when a primitive type of man was already in existence. The
remains were indeed somewhat scanty, consisting of the roof of the
skull, a thigh bone, and a fragment of the lower jaw, the former
two of which are illustrated in Figs. 139 and 140. From these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
fragments of the skeleton numerous deductions have been drawn,
of greater or less probability. It may be said with practical
certainty, however, that this ape-man was of the size of a smallish
man, and that he was accustomed to walk and stand in the characteristically
human erect attitude. The cranial capacity has been
calculated at from 850 to 1000 cubic centimetres, or considerably
greater than the highest existing apes, and about equal to
that of the lowest known human specimens. His statue, as his
discoverer conceived him, is illustrated in
Fig. 141.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>A restoration of the skull is shown in Fig.
142, and it is apparent that in respect of the
shape of the roof, at least, the Pithecanthropus
stands just about midway between the Chimpanzee
and the most primitive living man.
The gradual approach to the human type, as
we move upwards in the primate scale, is very
striking. The Pithecanthropus is by some
regarded as the result of an abortive attempt
at 'man making,' by others as a true transition
form. We cannot in any case be very far from
the truth if we hang up his picture among the
portraits of our ancestors, for the transitional
form would necessarily be closely similar to
him in its main features.</p>

<p>The next ancestor of whom we have any
knowledge is definitely a human being. This
is the primitive man who inhabited Europe in earlier Diluvial
times, particularly in the interval between the first and the
second great ice ages. To him, from the place of his first
discovery, the name of the Neandertal man has been applied,
and he is classed by scientists as belonging to a different species
from modern man, the latter being named <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Homo sapiens</i>,
while he is given the less flattering name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Homo primigenius</i>.
He was characterised, as may readily be seen from the skull
illustrated in Fig. 143, by a very low and receding forehead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
with heavy ridges of bone over the eyes. In shape of head he
stands midway between the Javan ape-man and the Australian
native, the lowest type existing at the present day. Further
ape-like peculiarities are the prominence of the lower part of the
face, the very large and massive lower jaw, and the receding chin,
shown in Fig. 144. From the skulls which have been found it is
possible to form a good idea of the man's appearance, which idea
has been expressed by a German sculptor in the bust illustrated
in Fig. 145.</p>

<p>One may be permitted to hazard a guess at the cause of the
process "running to brain," which is the main feature of the
last phases of man's Evolution. The most probable theory seems
to be that man came into existence owing to the disappearance
of forest over an area inhabited by some high anthropoid ape.
Ill-adapted as this ape would certainly be for a life on the plains,
it was saved from extinction only by its high intelligence. And
as cunning and reason would now, in the new environment, be
the most important assets, the process of natural selection made for
progress chiefly in respect of these characters.</p>

<p>The faculty of articulate speech, which we must regard as
an accidental result of the great brain development, has given the
human species that great advantage which it possesses over all
other animals of being able to accumulate knowledge and experience
from generation to generation. It is this mass of experience,
which is not inherent in man's nature, but has to be impressed
afresh on each successive generation, which accounts for man's
unique position in the animal world. But it is no part of the
scheme of this book to deal with the evolution of language or
invention or culture, and we must conclude.</p>

<p>Mankind are divisible into many types and races, some of
which, like the Australian aborigines and the Veddas of Ceylon,
are relatively primitive, others like the Germanic races being
undoubtedly high in the series. None of the differences are
sufficient, however, to make it necessary to regard mankind except
as members of a single species. The lower races have from time
to time disappeared before the higher, and the process continues

However much we may regret it, this process
has undoubtedly been a great factor in the progress of the species
as a whole.</p>

<p>Within the cultivated races, however, man has practically
ceased to evolve, at least in so far as concerns the main lines
on which his Evolution has thus far proceeded. For in creating
the artificial conditions of civilisation, he refuses any longer to
be governed by the stern law of nature, which decides that the
fit shall live and multiply, and the unfit surely perish. There is
in fact evidence that conditions of civilisation are making for
retrogression rather than for progress, a state of affairs that is
worthy of the most serious consideration. The only rational
and scientific remedy that has been offered for this state of affairs
is the institution of some moderate system of artificially guiding
man's further Evolution.</p>

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
